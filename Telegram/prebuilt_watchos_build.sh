# Worker for the apple_prebuilt_watchos_application Bazel rule.
#
# Builds the tgwatch watch app via xcodebuild (device, Release, UNSIGNED), then
# — if a provisioning profile is supplied — codesigns the app and its nested
# frameworks with the watchkitapp provisioning profile and a matching identity,
# and finally zips the .app into the rule's output archive.
#
# The host ios_application embeds this archive under Watch/ and re-seals the host;
# it does NOT re-sign the watch app, so the watch signing must happen here.
#
# Args:
#   $1 source_path  Execroot-relative path to the committed in-repo snapshot
#                   (Telegram/WatchApp), which contains tgwatch.xcodeproj.
#   $2 output_zip   Path (declared by Bazel) to write the .app archive to
#   $3 api_id       TG_API_ID build setting
#   $4 api_hash     TG_API_HASH build setting
#   $5 identity     Codesigning identity (SHA1 hash); empty => derived from $6's cert
#   $6 profile      Path to the watchkitapp .mobileprovision; empty => unsigned build
#   $7 infoplist    Path (declared by Bazel) to copy the built Info.plist to
#   $8 versions_json versions.json (key 'app' => CFBundleShortVersionString)
#   $9 build_number CFBundleVersion
#   $10 watch_bundle_id  PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER for xcodebuild (the watch app id,
#                   "<host>.watchkitapp"); empty => keep the project default. xcodebuild
#                   bakes it into CFBundleIdentifier (and signs with it); the Info.plist
#                   derives WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier from it via
#                   $(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER:base), so no post-build plist patching.
