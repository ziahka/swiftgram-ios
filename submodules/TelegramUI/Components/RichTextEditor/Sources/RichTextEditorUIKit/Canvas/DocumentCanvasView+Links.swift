/// Link commands. Like the character toggles, they operate over the same targets as
/// `characterFormatTargets()` — every leaf region the text selection touches, or every cell of a
/// structurally-selected table row/column — so a link is continuous across cells. A link carries a
/// value, so these build on `applyCharacterAttribute` (a value-set sibling of `applyCharacterToggle`)
/// rather than the toggle engine. A bare collapsed caret (no table selection) is a no-op. The visible
/// blue styling (no underline) is injected into the live storage here AND emitted by the mapper on
/// rebuild, and suppressed on read-back — so the model stays link-only (see `AttributedStringMapper`).
