# RichTextEditorMediaView — module guide

Host-side renderers for media (photo / video / location / audio) embedded in the **RichText editor**
(`submodules/TelegramUI/Components/RichTextEditor`, behind the `debugRichText` flag). The editor owns a
narrow seam — `RichTextMediaItemView` (a `UIView` with `update(size:)`) — and resolves each `.media`
block to one of these views via a host-registered provider, then positions/sizes/culls it
(`DocumentCanvasView+Media.syncMediaItemViews`). This module supplies the concrete views; it depends on
`AccountContext`/`TelegramCore` (so it can't live inside the editor package, which is account-free).

## Types

- **`MediaItemNodeView`** — the `RichTextMediaItemView` adapter + **3-way dispatcher** by media kind,
  created once per media occurrence at three call sites (`RichTextAttachmentScreen`, `ChatControllerNode`,
  `ChatInterfaceStateInputPanels`). Accepts a `cornerRadius: CGFloat = 0` init param: when > 0 and the
  audio branch was NOT taken, sets `layer.cornerRadius` + `masksToBounds` on the container (child fills
  bounds, so the rounded rect clips it). Photo/video/location round to 10pt at the two composer call
  sites; audio stays square (check is `audioView == nil`); `RichTextAttachmentScreen` (article editor)
  leaves the default 0 and stays square. **Container-aware (added 2026-07-08):** a `convenience init(context:items:…)`
  taking `[(media: EngineMedia, naturalSize: CGSize)]` composes a **mosaic** of N single-cell
  `RichTextMediaContentComponent`s for a photo/video container (`items.count >= 2`); `items.count == 1`
  delegates straight to the existing per-kind single-media `init` above, so a container of 1 renders
  identically to before. See "Mosaic containers" below.
  - **audio** (`.file` && (`isMusic` || `isVoice`)) → `StandaloneInstantPageAudioView` (a playable,
    themeable row; `audioColorOverride` themes it to the editor accent/text scheme).
  - **location** (`.geo`) → `StandaloneInstantPageImageView` + an `InstantPageMapAttribute`
    (600×300, zoom 15) — the InstantPage `.geo` snapshot+pin path.
  - **photo / video** (everything else, incl. image-mime `.file`) → **`RichTextMediaContentComponent`**
    hosted in a `ComponentHostView<Empty>`.
- **`RichTextMediaContentComponent`** — the composable ComponentFlow renderer for **one** still/video
  poster. Owns its own `TransformImageNode` + media-fetch signal + aspect-fill layout + (video) a static
  `RadialStatusNode.play(.white)` overlay, **decoupled from `InstantPageImageNode`**. Signal sources match
  the old shared path: `.image` → `chatMessagePhoto` (+`chatMessagePhotoInteractiveFetched`); image-mime
  `.file` → `instantPageImageFile` (+`freeMediaFileInteractiveFetched`); video `.file` → `chatMessageVideo`.

## Load-bearing invariants

- **`RichTextMediaContentComponent.==` compares identity only** (`context ===` + `media.id`), NOT any
  per-layout value. The editor calls `update(size:)` every layout pass; equality must hold across resizes
  so the fetch signal is **bound once** (a `didBind`/`boundMediaId` guard in the `View`). Comparing a
  changing value here would re-issue the fetch every pass → flicker / wasted fetches.
- **Interaction is control-scoped via `hitTest` — the poster passes through to the editor.** The component
  now carries interactive chrome (a glass "more" button); to make it tappable WITHOUT stealing the editor's
  own taps (caret placement / media-select highlight), the whole media path is a **hit-test pass-through**:
  - `RichTextMediaContentComponent.View.hitTest` returns the button ONLY when the touch lands on it (routed
    through the button's `GlassBackgroundContainerView`, whose own `hitTest` is already control-or-nil), else
    `nil`. **Add any future controls to this override** — do NOT rely on `isUserInteractionEnabled` alone.
  - `MediaItemNodeView.hitTest` forwards into the photo/video `contentHost` and returns the control, or `nil`
    for the poster area and for the audio/location branches entirely (those stay non-interactive as before).
    Standard visibility/`point(inside:)` guards keep a culled (hidden) media view from claiming a touch.
  - Editor side (`RichTextEditor` module): `mediaOverlay` is a **`MediaPassthroughOverlayView`** (interactive,
    but `hitTest` returns `nil` unless a media view claims the touch), and the canvas's recognizers yield to a
    claimed touch via `gestureRecognizer(_:shouldReceive:)` (→ the media control gets a clean, un-cancelled
    touch). The contract is: *"if the media view returns anything from `hitTest`, leave it be; otherwise run
    the editor's default tap logic."* The button ACTION (`moreButtonPressed`) is still an empty stub — the
    plumbing lands first.
- **Aspect-FILL** (`dimensions.cgSize.aspectFilled(availableSize)`) — the editor already sizes the host
  rect to the media aspect (so fill == exact fit), and fill is the right primitive for future mosaic
  cropping. `emptyColor` placeholder = `theme.list.mediaPlaceholderColor`.
- **View-frame ownership** (repo-wide rule): the component lays out against `bounds`; the editor owns the
  view's frame via `update(size:)`. `MediaItemNodeView` only frames its single child to its own `bounds`.
- Audio is **caption-less** in the editor model; location/audio rendering is byte-unchanged from the
  pre-component implementation (only the photo/video branch was rewritten).

## Mosaic containers (photo/video, implemented 2026-07-08)

A media block can hold multiple photos/videos (`items.count >= 2`, one shared caption — model + send/edit
detail in `docs/richtext-composer.md` §4 and `docs/instantpage-richtext.md`). `MediaItemNodeView`'s
`items:` initializer runs the **same `MosaicLayout` engine** grouped album messages use
(`chatMessageBubbleMosaicLayout`, now a shared dual-build package) to place one `RichTextMediaContentComponent`
cell per item at its mosaic frame — the single-cell component itself is unchanged (see its description
above).

- **Cell-level view reuse is load-bearing** (`MosaicCellLayout.swift`, `MosaicCellDiff`): on every
  `update`, cells are diffed by `EngineMedia.Id` — not rebuilt — via a **multiset greedy match** (handles
  the same media appearing twice in one container, order-independent). A surviving cell is re-`update(size:)`d
  to its new mosaic frame with the **same `RichTextMediaContentComponent` identity**, so the component's
  identity-only `==` (`context ===` + `media.id`, see the invariant above) keeps its fetch **bound once**;
  only a newly-added `mediaID` creates a cell, only a removed one is torn down. Rebuilding cells on every
  mutation would re-issue every surviving image's fetch (flicker + wasted work) — exactly what that
  identity-only equality was designed to prevent.
- **`onControlTapped` is 4-arg**: `(RichTextMediaControlKind, itemIndex: Int?, anchorView: UIView, sourceRect: CGRect)`.
  A per-cell tap reports its own `itemIndex`; the container-level more button reports `nil` (whole-block,
  matching the pre-container behavior).

## Media aspect handling (added 2026-07-08)

**Height capping**: editor media slot height is capped at `min(1000, canvasWidth)` where `canvasWidth` = media area width including horizontal bleed — "media is never taller than its own display width, up to 1000pt". Applied in `MediaBlockBox.imageDisplaySize` (single) and `MediaBlockBox.mosaicSize` (mosaic total); mirrored in `MediaItemNodeView.updateMosaic`, both packing `chatMessageBubbleMosaicLayout(maxSize: (W, min(1000,W)))`. **These two MUST stay in lockstep** (box reserves the slot, renderer fills it).

**Single media aspect handling**: a lone photo/video now renders **aspect-fit + `resizeMode: .blurBackground`** (`RichTextMediaContentComponent.usesAspectFit`). Portrait/panorama shows whole, centered, with a blurred backdrop filling letterbox/pillarbox gap (chat's `PhotoResources.blurBackground` path), instead of cropped. Landscape filling its slot pays no blur (`boundingSize == imageSize`).

**Mosaic cells remain crop-to-fill** (`aspectFilled`, `usesAspectFit == false`); total mosaic height is capped by scale-to-fit + horizontal centering when width-driven pack exceeds the cap (`MediaItemNodeView.updateMosaic`).

**Non-identity state in `usesAspectFit`**: it is a `var` NOT in `RichTextMediaContentComponent.==` (equality stays `context ===` + `media.id` so the fetch binds once). `MediaItemNodeView` sets it **every layout pass** (single → true, mosaic cell → false), so a cell reused across a 1↔2 transition switches mode.

Spec/plan retained in-tree: `docs/superpowers/{specs/2026-07-08-richtext-media-fit-blur-height-cap-design.md,plans/2026-07-08-richtext-media-fit-blur-height-cap.md}`.

## Dedicated add button (photo/video containers, added 2026-07-08)

`MediaItemNodeView` hosts a dedicated glass **"+"** add button in the **top-right** corner (36×36, 8pt inset), styled like the per-cell ⋯ button (`GlassBackgroundContainerView` + `GlassBackgroundView` + a `Chat/Context Menu/Add` icon; needs `import AppBundle` + the `//submodules/AppBundle` BUILD dep for `UIImage(bundleImageName:)`). Shown ONLY when `showsControls && mosaicContext != nil` (article editor + photo/video containers — never the composer, which passes `showsControls: false`, nor audio/location). Tapping fires `onControlTapped(.add, itemIndex: nil, …)` through the existing seam → `MediaControlRequest(control: .add)`; `RichTextAttachmentScreen`'s `.add` case opens the picker + `request.addMore(...)`. The per-cell ⋯ menu is now **Delete-only** (Add moved to the dedicated button).

`hitTest` returns the add button first (guarded on `!isHidden`) so it's tappable while the poster passes through to the editor. The interaction seam (hit-test pass-through, component-level return-or-nil, recognizer yielding) is documented in the Load-bearing invariants section above.

Spec/plan in-tree: `docs/superpowers/{specs/2026-07-08-richtext-media-add-button-design.md,plans/2026-07-08-richtext-media-add-button.md}`.

## Future iterations (planned, not yet implemented)

- **Higher-quality video poster.** Video currently shows the file's small embedded thumbnail (via
  `chatMessageVideo` — same source as the old `InstantPageImageNode` path; runtime-confirmed low-res
  2026-06-29). A future pass should load a larger representation or a generated frame for the poster.
- **Interaction:** the hit-test plumbing is in place (taps reach the component's controls — see the
  interaction invariant above); still to wire are the actual actions — the "more" button menu
  (`moreButtonPressed` is an empty stub) and tap / long-press (open / preview / context menu).
- **Mosaic — implemented, see "Mosaic containers" above.** The single-medium component was built
  composable (no editor-seam coupling) specifically so the mosaic wrapper could reuse it directly, which
  is exactly what landed.
- **Slideshow — implemented (2026-07-17), see "Mosaic ↔ slideshow toggle" below.** A multi-media block
  (`items.count >= 2`) can be toggled between the mosaic grid and a swipeable slideshow carousel; grouping
  no longer always renders as a mosaic.

## Mosaic ↔ slideshow toggle (photo/video containers, added 2026-07-17)

A per-block `MediaBlock.displayMode` (`.mosaic` / `.slideshow`, default `.mosaic`, mirrored on the
composer currency `ChatInputMedia.displayMode`) drives whether a `items.count >= 2` container renders as
the packed `MosaicLayout` grid (sent as InstantPage `.collage`) or a swipeable carousel with paging dots
(sent as `.slideshow` — the InstantPage V2 slideshow renderer already existed; the editor now *produces*
it). **Article editor only** (`showsControls && mosaicContext != nil && count >= 2`); the composer stays
mosaic-only.

- **In-editor render (`MediaItemNodeView`):** `updatePhotoVideoLayout` dispatches to `updateMosaic` or
  `updateSlideshow` by mode. Both reuse the SAME pooled `mosaicCells` via `applyCells(into:frames:…)` —
  the slideshow path re-parents the cell hosts into a `HorizontalPagingScrollView` (one full-width page
  each) + a `Display.PageControlNode` at `y = height - 20`; `teardownSlideshowChrome` moves cells back to
  `self` before removing the scroll view so no fetch is torn down (no re-flash across a toggle).
  `HorizontalPagingScrollView` begins its pan only for predominantly-horizontal drags so the editor's
  vertical scroll still wins. `hitTest` order: add/toggle buttons → per-cell controls → the scroll view
  (for paging).
- **Toggle button:** a 36×36 glass button left of "+", shown only for a `count >= 2` article-editor
  container; icon is `rectangle.stack` (while mosaic) / `square.grid.2x2` (while slideshow) — it depicts
  the layout you switch TO. Fires `RichTextMediaControlKind.toggleLayout` through the media-control seam →
  `MediaControlRequest.toggleLayout` → `DocumentCanvasView.toggleMediaDisplayMode(blockID:)` (one undo
  step, rebuild-in-place like `toggleMediaSpoiler`). The composer's control switch handles `.toggleLayout`
  as a no-op.
- **Box height:** `MediaBlockBox.slideshowSize(maxWidth:)` = tallest item fitted to width, capped at
  `min(1000, width)`; `nodeSize`/caret stay caption-derived.
- **Reuse signature:** `syncMediaItemViews` folds `displayMode.rawValue` into the media-view items
  signature, so a toggle re-provides the view; the provider seam is 4-param
  `(items, blockID, displayMode, existing)`.

## History

The photo/video renderer was extracted from the shared `InstantPageImageNode` path into the standalone
`RichTextMediaContentComponent` on 2026-06-29 (build-green + runtime-verified on iPhone 17). Location and
audio were intentionally left on the `StandaloneInstantPage*` views. (Per the RichTextEditor convention,
the per-phase design spec/plan are not retained in-tree — this file is the durable record.)

Multi-media (mosaic) containers landed 2026-07-08 — full app build green. Design + plan are retained
in-tree: `docs/superpowers/{specs/2026-07-08-richtext-multi-media-container-design.md,plans/2026-07-08-richtext-multi-media-container.md}`.

Media aspect handling landed 2026-07-08 (full app build green) — single media now aspect-fit + blur,
mosaic cells crop-to-fill, height capped at `min(1000, canvasWidth)`, box + renderer in lockstep.
Spec/plan in-tree: `docs/superpowers/{specs/2026-07-08-richtext-media-fit-blur-height-cap-design.md,plans/2026-07-08-richtext-media-fit-blur-height-cap.md}`.

Dedicated media add button landed 2026-07-08 (top-right corner Glass-styled +, article editor mosaic containers only; per-cell menu Delete-only; full app build green). Spec/plan in-tree: `docs/superpowers/{specs/2026-07-08-richtext-media-add-button-design.md,plans/2026-07-08-richtext-media-add-button.md}`.
