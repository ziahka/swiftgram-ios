# InstantPage V2 & rich-text message rendering

This file documents the **rich-text message** pipeline and the **InstantPage V2** renderer that backs it.

A rich message is a `RichTextMessageAttribute` carrying an `InstantPage` (sent with `text: ""`), produced when typed markdown contains structure the regular message-entity set can't represent (headings, lists, tables, formulas, nested blockquotes) and drawn by `ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode` via the InstantPage V2 layout/renderer — including AI-streaming progressive reveal, inline custom emoji, and entity (mention / hashtag / …) cases. It also covers the send / edit / copy / paste round-trips between markdown and `InstantPage`.

These are detailed, non-obvious invariants — read the relevant section before touching the corresponding code. (Moved out of `CLAUDE.md` to keep that file focused; `CLAUDE.md` retains a brief pointer back to here.)

## AI streaming animation (rich-text bubbles)

`ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode` progressively reveals InstantPage V2 content while `TypingDraftMessageAttribute` is on the message. Mirrors the older animation in `ChatMessageTextBubbleContentNode`, adapted to the heterogeneous V2 layout. The "Thinking…" indicator is now server-sent as `InstantPageBlock.thinking` rendered inside the pageView (see "InstantPage thinking blocks" section).

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Components/StreamingTextReveal/Sources/TextRevealController.swift` | Pacing controller, shared by both bubbles. EWMA inter-arrival → velocity-smoothed cursor. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` (`InstantPageV2TextView`) | Drawing split: private `TextRenderView` does `draw(_)` inside a `renderContainer` whose layer carries a `revealMaskLayer`; new chars spawn cropped `SnippetLayer` siblings of the render container that animate in (blur + alpha + scale + position) and are absorbed into the mask on completion. Ported from `InteractiveTextComponent`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2RevealCost.swift` | `InstantPageV2RevealCostMap` + `InstantPageV2View.applyReveal(revealedCount:costMap:animated:)`. Bridges the global width-based cursor to per-text-view char counts (via `charCountForWidthBudget`) and per-item visibility / table-row pop-in. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `InstantPageTextLine.characterRects` (line-local CT coords, baseline-relative positive-up) populated when `computeRevealCharacterRects: true` is passed to `layoutInstantPageV2(...)`. Uses `CTFontGetBoundingRectsForGlyphs` for actual glyph ink, not advance widths. |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Components/Chat/ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode/...` | Streaming detection (`TypingDraftMessageAttribute`), display-link wiring, container sizing. The hardcoded "Thinking…" header was removed; thinking is now rendered by the pageView via `InstantPageBlock.thinking`. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Cost unit is points of width, not characters.** Each item's cost = its width in points along the reading direction. Text contributes sum of glyph ink widths; non-text items contribute `frame.width`. Table cells are floored at `cell.frame.width` so narrow- or empty-cell tables don't race through the cursor. Reveal pace becomes "points per second" — uniform across content types.
- **Mask uses per-glyph ink bounds, unioned per line.** Each revealed glyph's mask rect comes from `CTFontGetBoundingRectsForGlyphs` (not advance widths) so italics, accents, descenders are covered exactly. Per line, glyphs are unioned into one mask rect; consecutive fully-revealed lines union further — fully-revealed prefix is always one `CALayer`.
- **`containerNode` does ALL the clipping.** During streaming, containerNode is sized to `revealedItemsMaxY` (no header offset, no closing pad; `streamingHeaderOffset` is `0.0`). The bubble itself is taller (`revealedContentSize.height + 2`) — the strip below containerNode is empty bubble background. pageView keeps its full `pageLayout.contentSize`; anything past containerNode's bottom is clipped at containerNode (`clipsToBounds = true` set in init). Do NOT shorten the pageView or set `pageView.clipsToBounds`.
- **The pageView is REUSED across `stableVersion` bumps for the same message id.** `ensurePageView` calls `existing.renderContext?.updateContent(webpage:)` (where `webpage` is now a `public private(set) var` with an `updateContent` mutator) and returns the existing view; `update(layout:)` then diffs item views by stable id, tearing down only views whose block was removed. The pageView is rebuilt only when the bubble is recycled with a different message or webpage. The reveal cursor on `TextRevealController` persists across chunks; the seed re-apply (`applyReveal(revealedCount: previousAnimateGlyphCount, …, animated: false)`) is now a continuation from the reused views' state, eliminating the per-chunk flash-of-full-text-then-mask that required the earlier from-scratch re-seed.
- **Layout cache key includes `message.stableVersion`.** Each AI chunk bumps stableVersion; without this the cached layout would shadow newly-arrived content.
- **`TypingDraftMessageAttribute` is the streaming gate.** Same trigger TextBubble uses. The InstantPage's `isComplete` flag is informational only.
- **Width-based cost → char count bridge.** Mask APIs (`updateRevealCharacterCount`) still take character counts. `applyRevealEntry` calls `charCountForWidthBudget(textItem:widthBudget:)` to translate the width-based local cursor into the per-text-view character count.
- **The hardcoded "Thinking…" header was removed.** `streamingStatusTextNode`, `streamingStatusShimmerView`, and the header-layout machinery no longer exist. `streamingHeaderOffset` is now a constant `0.0` — the pageView starts at the top of the bubble. The "Thinking…" indicator is now server-sent as `InstantPageBlock.thinking` and rendered inside the pageView (see "InstantPage thinking blocks" section below).
- **Display-link tick re-layouts on extent change.** Tick reads `revealedContentSize` at the new cursor; if the height differs from the previous cursor, calls `requestFullUpdate`. So the bubble grows in flight when the cursor crosses a line/item boundary, not just between chunks. Tick passes `animated: true` to `applyReveal` to fire the snippet pop-in.

### Status node (date/time/checks) positioning

The `ChatMessageDateAndStatusNode` mirrors TextBubble's placement, adapted to the heterogeneous V2 layout. The node is a child of `self` (the content node), **not** of the clipping `containerNode`, so it is never clipped — the bubble height must be grown to contain it.

- **X is a fixed left edge, not the last line's `minX`.** Anchor x = `pageHorizontalInset` (10pt, the page layout's text inset; pageView sits at self-x 0). The status layout is measured with `boundingWidth - 2·pageHorizontalInset` (mirrors TextBubble's `boundingWidth - sideInsets`) so the right-aligned date lands at the right inset instead of off the bubble. Using `lastTextLineFrame.minX` (which is large for nested/indented last lines) shoved the date off to the right.
- **Trail the last line only when the bottom-most item is text.** `lastTextLineFrameIfLastItemIsText(in:)` (in `InstantPageV2Layout.swift`) returns the last line frame *only* when the bottom-most top-level item (max `maxY`) is a `.text`; otherwise nil, so the date wraps below all content (anchored at `contentSize.height`). For tables/images/etc. the date must not trail text buried above the final item.
- **InstantPage draws the baseline at the line frame's `maxY`** (`InstantPageRenderer` draws each line at `lineOrigin.y + lineFrame.height`), so the visible text of a plain line sits ~5pt below `maxY`. A date that **trails** on the line (`statusHeight == 0`) adds `trailingBottomPadding` (5pt) to align with the text; a date that **wraps** onto its own line below (`statusHeight > 0`) sits at the bare `maxY`. The pad is 0 for lines taller than their font line height (a tall inline attachment, e.g. a formula, already pushes `maxY` down). `lastTextLineFrameIfLastItemIsText` returns `(frame, trailingBottomPadding)`; the bubble applies the pad only in the trailing case.
- **Bubble height leaves ~6pt below the date.** One unified formula for all cases: `boundingSize.height = max(boundingSize.height, statusBottomEdge + 6.0)`, where `statusBottomEdge = statusAnchorY + max(1, statusHeight)`. The `statusAnchorY` in the measure (`continue`) closure must mirror the `statusFrameY` in the apply closure exactly, or the date will be clipped/misplaced. (`streamingHeaderOffset` is `0.0` — there is no header offset to add.) 6pt matches TextBubble's bottom bubble inset.
- **`hasDraft` adds the same 6pt at the streaming site.** The status max() above is gated by `!hasDraft`, so during streaming (status hidden, alpha=0) it can't supply the bubble's bottom inset. A separate `boundingSize.height += 6.0` inside `if hasDraft` in the SizeBlock closure does it instead — same 6pt, so the streaming bubble's bottom breathing room matches its post-stream height and there's no 6pt grow-pop when the status node fades in at finalize. The `hadDraft && !hasDraft` finalize pass doesn't need it because `!hasDraft` re-enables the status max(). If you ever refactor the `+6.0` constant out of the status max() into a `bottomInset` (TextBubble's pattern), kill this separate term at the same time — they're two ends of the same invariant.
- **Trailing full-width media → overlaid pill, no reserved space.** When the bottom-most laid-out item is full-width visual media (`.mediaImage`/`.mediaVideo`/`.mediaCoverImage`/`.mediaMap`/`.slideshow`/`.mediaPlaceholder`), `lastFullWidthMediaFrame(in:)` (`InstantPageV2Layout.swift`) returns its frame and the status switches from `.Bubble{Incoming,Outgoing}` to the image-style `.Image{Incoming,Outgoing}` pill, positioned at the media's bottom-right corner (`layoutConstants.image.statusInsets`, with the X anchor clamped to `contentSize.width` to drop the 4pt `instantPageV2MediaEdgeBleed`), and reserving **no** vertical space — the width-growth and the `statusBottomEdge + 6.0` height reservation are both gated on `mediaStatusFrame == nil`, and the status layout input becomes `.standalone(reactionSettings:)`. The full-width gate (`frame.width >= contentSize.width - 12.0`) excludes a narrow/centered trailing media, which keeps the normal below-content bubble status.
- **A pill can't host multi-row reactions, so non-inline reactions move outside the bubble.** The `wantsReactionsOutside` decision must be made *before* layout (it feeds `ChatMessageBubbleItemNode`'s pre-layout `needReactions`), so it can't consult laid-out items — hence two detectors. The **prepare phase** does a model-only structural check (the effective `InstantPage`'s last block is empty-caption visual media) and reports `ChatMessageBubbleContentProperties.wantsReactionsOutside = endsWithMedia && hasNonInlineReactions`; `ChatMessageBubbleItemNode` ORs that flag into `needReactions` (`if needReactions || forceReactionsOutside`), routing reactions to the external reaction-buttons node. The **layout phase** does the authoritative full-width check for the visual pill (above) and passes empty `reactions`/`reactionPeers` to the status node. Inline reactions stay *in* the pill via the `.standalone` reaction settings, mirroring `ChatMessageInteractiveMediaNode`. The two detectors can disagree only for a pathologically narrow trailing media (structural says "external", layout declines the pill) — accepted and documented, does not occur with server rich media (always full-width).

## InstantPage V2 table — flush frame, inset borders, rounded corners

A V2 `.table` block's item frame is **full-width / flush** with the bubble interior (so a horizontally-scrollable wide table's scroll container bleeds edge-to-edge), but the actual grid **borders start at the body-text side inset** — matching the V1 renderer. The grid card also has a **10pt rounded outer border**.

### Non-obvious invariants

- **`InstantPageV2TableItem.contentInset` (= page `horizontalInset`) is the linchpin.** `layoutTable` (`InstantPageV2Layout.swift`) sizes columns against `contentBoundingWidth = boundingWidth − horizontalInset·2` (so a fitting table aligns with body text on both sides) and stores `contentInset` on the item; the item `frame.width` is the flush `boundingWidth`, and `contentSize.width` stays the **bare grid width** (`totalWidth`, no inset).
- **The renderer (`InstantPageV2TableView`) realizes the inset as a view shift, not baked coordinates.** In `init` AND `update` it shifts the grid `contentView` to `x: contentInset`, sets `scrollView.contentSize.width = contentSize.width + contentInset * 2.0` (**margin on both sides**, mirroring V1's `InstantPageScrollableNode`), and `scrollView.clipsToBounds = true`. Cells, inner border lines, and the title stay x=0-relative inside `contentView`, so the single shift carries them all; the rounded outer border is `contentView.layer`'s own border (see below), which wraps the shifted layer automatically.
- **Scrollable tables clip to the full width with no inset on the clip.** The inset lives inside the scroll content as a symmetric margin on both sides (`contentInset * 2.0`): a fitting table (`grid + 2·inset ≤ boundingWidth`) doesn't scroll and shows both-side inset; an overflowing table rests with its left border at the inset and scrolls until its right border reaches a matching trailing inset (it does **not** jam flush against the screen edge — matches V1). The scroll-indicator threshold and `contentSize.width` use the same `+ contentInset * 2.0`, so "does it scroll" is exactly `grid > boundingWidth − 2·inset`.
- **Manual cell-coordinate helpers MUST add `contentInset`.** Because the shift is a real `contentView` frame change, UIKit `hitTest` and `self.convert(_:to:)` paths (`propagateVisibilityRect`, the row-reveal mask) handle it automatically — but the *manual* coordinate helpers `findTextItem` / `collectSelectableTextItems` (the live tap / URL / text-selection path) compute cell/title positions arithmetically and must add `table.contentInset` to the x-offset, or in-cell hit-testing is off by the inset. (These helpers still do **not** account for the table's live horizontal `scrollView.contentOffset` — a pre-existing limitation, so in-cell hit-testing is only correct at scroll offset 0.) The dead-but-symmetric `lastTextLineFrame(in:)` table branch has the same omission but has no callers.
- **The 10pt rounded outer border is `contentView.layer`'s own border, NOT sublayers.** `v2TableCornerRadius = 10.0` (`InstantPageV2Layout.swift`). The renderer sets `contentView.layer.cornerRadius`/`borderColor`/`borderWidth = bordered ? v2TableBorderWidth : 0.0` in BOTH `init` and `update` (the four straight outer-edge rect layers were removed; `lineLayers` now holds only inner grid lines). **Border-only — deliberately no `masksToBounds`:** `cornerRadius` rounds the layer's border without clipping contents (filled corner cells round their own fills separately — see next bullet), and there is **zero interaction with the streaming reveal mask** (`contentView.layer.mask`, set only during AI streaming) — the border reveals row-by-row with the rows and is part of the masked layer. The rounded card belongs to the grid (scrolls with it). For a non-empty-title table (never produced by markdown/AI), the border wraps title+grid since `contentView` includes the title region — an accepted, approved nuance.
- **Filled corner cells round their own fills to match the border.** A header/striped cell's background is a stripe `CALayer`; `tableStripeCornerMask(cellFrame:gridWidth:gridHeight:effectiveBorderWidth:)` detects which grid corners the cell's (grid-local) frame touches — `firstCol/firstRow` via `frame.min{X,Y} <= effectiveBorderWidth/2 + 0.5`, `lastCol/lastRow` via `frame.max{X,Y} >= grid{Width,Height} - …` (gridWidth = `item.contentSize.width`, gridHeight = `item.contentSize.height - gridOffsetY`) — and rounds only those corners: `stripe.cornerRadius = max(0, v2TableCornerRadius - effectiveBorderWidth)` (the `-borderWidth` leaves an even border ring; borderless → full radius) + `stripe.maskedCorners`, in BOTH `init` and `update`. A `CALayer`'s `backgroundColor` honors `cornerRadius`+`maskedCorners` with no `masksToBounds`. A full-width (colspan) header rounds both top corners; a one-row filled table rounds all four; bottom corners round only when the last row is filled. The empty-mask branch resets `cornerRadius = 0` **and** `maskedCorners = []` so reused stripes (persist across streaming chunks) don't keep stale rounding. Detection is grid-local, so it's independent of the `contentInset` shift / horizontal scroll.

## InstantPage V2 block media — flush (edge-to-edge), un-rounded

Every V2 block-media kind lays out **flush** with the bubble interior (0 inset, full bounding width) and **un-rounded** (cornerRadius 0). The bubble's existing rounded clipping container rounds any media that meets the bubble's top/bottom edge. V1 (`InstantPageLayout.swift`) is unchanged. (Audio is **also** full-width / x = 0 as of the V2 audio port, but it does not use this helper — it has its own `layoutAudio` arm; the wrapped `InstantPageAudioNode` supplies its own 17pt internal content inset. See the "InstantPage V2 audio/music" section below.)

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `instantPageV2MediaFrame(naturalSize:flush:cornerRadius:boundingWidth:horizontalInset:)` — the shared frame helper; `instantPageV2MediaEdgeBleed` constant; the `flush: Bool` parameter on `layoutTypedMediaWithCaption` (image/video/webEmbed-cover/map) and `layoutMediaWithCaption` (webEmbed-placeholder/postEmbed/channelBanner/relatedArticles). (Collage/slideshow and **audio** no longer route through these — see their dedicated sections.) |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2MediaViews.swift`, `…/InstantPageRenderer.swift` (`InstantPageV2MediaPlaceholderView`) | Renderer — **no change needed**: every media view + the placeholder view already does `clipsToBounds = item.cornerRadius > 0.0`, so cornerRadius 0 means the view doesn't self-clip; the bubble's `containerNode` clips. |
| `…/Chat/ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode/…` | The clipping container: `containerNode` (`clipsToBounds = true`, `cornerRadius = layoutConstants.image.defaultCornerRadius` ≈ 15–16pt) is what rounds flush media at the bubble edge. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **`flush` is a parameter, not inferred from cornerRadius.** **Every** remaining media call site now passes `flush: true`. Audio — the former lone `flush: false` caller — was moved to its own `layoutAudio` arm in the V2 audio port, so `instantPageV2MediaFrame`'s `flush == false` branch is now **dead code** (a candidate for a follow-up cleanup: drop the `flush` parameter and the inset branch entirely). On the flush path the helper forces the returned corner radius to `0` regardless of the caller's `cornerRadius` argument (the legacy `8.0`/`0.0` args at the call sites are now inert — kept as-is, documented in the helper).
- **Small images are NOT upscaled.** The `scale = min(availableWidth / naturalSize.width, 1.0)` cap is kept (now against `availableWidth = boundingWidth`). A small image stays at natural size, **flush-left at x = 0** (not stretched to full width). Large images (the common server/AI case) fill the width.
- **Full-width media bleeds `instantPageV2MediaEdgeBleed` (4pt) past the trailing edge.** The pageView sits at `x: -1` inside `containerNode` (a border-hiding hairline), so a frame at `x: 0, width: boundingWidth` falls ~1px short of the container's right rounded-clip edge → a 1px corner notch. A small over-bleed on **full-width** items only (`fillsWidth = scaledSize.width >= availableWidth - 1.0`) closes it; a genuinely small image gets no bleed. **The bleed never widens the bubble** because `layoutInstantPageV2` clamps `contentSize.width = min(maxX, boundingWidth)` (gated by `context.fitToWidth`, which both callers — the rich bubble and the send preview — pass `true`).
- **Captions stay inset.** `layoutCaptionAndCredit` is still called with the page `horizontalInset` and offset by the **un-bled** `scaledSize.height`; the caption/credit text is inset under a full-bleed image. The `isCover && captionHeight > 0` cover-padding block is unchanged.
- **Audio is no longer routed through this helper.** As of the V2 audio port it has a dedicated `layoutAudio` arm emitting a typed `.mediaAudio` item at a full-width (x = 0), height-48 frame (matching V1 `InstantPageLayout.swift`); the wrapped `InstantPageAudioNode` self-insets its content by 17pt, and audio does **not** participate in `instantPageV2MediaEdgeBleed` (its node background is transparent). See the dedicated "InstantPage V2 audio/music" section below.
- **`.map` blocks get a 600×300 (2:1) fallback when the sender omits dimensions.** AI/server-sent `.map` blocks can arrive with `dimensions == 0×0` (the wire `w`/`h` are *required* `Int32`, but the sender may put 0; our `pageBlockMap` parse and both serializers — Postbox `sw`/`sh`, FlatBuffers `required dimensions` — preserve whatever arrives, so the zero originates upstream). A zero `naturalSize.height` hits `instantPageV2MediaFrame`'s `else` branch and returns a **height-0** frame: the map collapses to no space, the caption slides up into it, and the V1 node's pin (positioned at `size.height*0.5 − 10 − pinSize/2`) floats over the caption. **The `.map` arm in `InstantPageV2Layout.swift` substitutes `PixelDimensions(600, 300)` whenever `width <= 0 || height <= 0`, and feeds that `effectiveDimensions` to BOTH the layout `naturalSize` AND the `InstantPageMapAttribute`** — the latter is essential because a `MapSnapshotMediaResource(width:0,height:0)` makes `MKMapSnapshotter` render nothing, so fixing only the frame would yield a correctly-sized *blank* box. Real web-article maps (the V1 renderer) always carry real dimensions, so V1 never trips this; the fallback is deliberately scoped to the V2 `.map` arm rather than V1 or the wire/parse layer.
- **`.map` blocks show a theme placeholder while the snapshot loads (2026-06-27).** The map image is generated on-demand by `MKMapSnapshotter` (`chatMapSnapshotImage` → `chatMapSnapshotData` self-fetches via `engine.resources.custom`), which takes ~seconds; the pin (`ChatMessageLiveLocationPositionNode`) draws immediately, so the map area was **blank (pin over transparent)** until the fetch completed. `InstantPageImageNode.layout()`'s `.geo` arm now passes `emptyColor: theme.list.mediaPlaceholderColor`, and `chatMapSnapshotImage` emits an **initial `nil`** frame that fills `emptyColor` when there's no image yet — **corner-safe** (`addCorners` runs after the fill, unlike a node `backgroundColor` which would bleed past rounded corners) and **gated on `emptyColor`** so callers that don't opt in keep the prior transparent loading state. Shared, so it applies to every map render: web instant pages, rich messages, AND the RichTextEditor's own **`.location` blocks**, which now author `.map` (`MediaKind.location` → `.map`; see `richtext-composer.md`).

## InstantPage V2 audio/music

`InstantPageBlock.audio` renders in V2 as a control **styled exactly like the standard music message bubble** (`ChatMessageInteractiveFileNode`'s music layout) — a dedicated `InstantPageV2AudioContentNode`, NOT the V1 `InstantPageAudioNode` (which V2 used in the first iteration and which still backs V1's full-page Instant View). It replaces the earlier inert grey `.mediaPlaceholder(kind: .audio)`. Playback stays on `InstantPageMediaPlaylist`, with two deliberate behavior changes for the rich-message context: the shared playlist identity is **message-scoped** so concurrent rich-message audio bubbles don't collide, and rich-message audio files are fetched via a **message reference** (not the synthesized webpage) so a stale file reference can revalidate.

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageMediaPlaylist.swift` | `InstantPageMediaPlaylistId` is a **public enum** — `.instantPage(webpageId:)` (V1 full-page IV) / `.richMessage(messageId:)` (V2 rich bubble). `InstantPageMediaPlaylist.init` takes an injected `playlistId:` (no longer derived from the webpage) and a `messageReference: MessageReference?` threaded into each `InstantPageMediaPlaylistItem`. The item's `fileReference(_:)` helper builds a `.message(message:media:)` file reference when a (resolvable-id) message reference is present, else the legacy `.webPage(...)`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2AudioContentNode.swift` | **The V2 control** — replicates `ChatMessageInteractiveFileNode`'s music layout: a Ø44 `SemanticStatusNode` (album art via `playerAlbumArt` + play/pause) + a small bottom-right `streamingStatusNode` download/progress overlay + title/performer `TextNode`s + a line `MediaPlayerScrubbingNode`. Big control play/pause from **our** `filteredPlaylistState`; small overlay download/progress from `messageMediaFileStatus`; tap via a `UITapGestureRecognizer` (`controlTapped` routes fetch / `play` / `togglePlayPause`); fetch via `messageMediaFileInteractiveFetched(fetchManager:…)`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageAudioNode.swift` | **V1 only** (full-page Instant View) — unchanged except `init` takes an injected `playlistId:`. No longer used by V2. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `InstantPageV2MediaAudioItem` (frame/media/webPage — no cornerRadius/attributes); the `.mediaAudio` `InstantPageV2LaidOutItem` case + its `frame`/`offsetBy`/`collectMedias` arms; the `.audio` block's `layoutAudio` arm (full-width x = 0, height 44 — the file node's music `normHeight`; the `InstantPageMedia` carries `caption: nil`/`credit: nil`, the visible caption is a separate item via `layoutCaptionAndCredit`). |

| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` | `InstantPageV2RenderContext.message: MessageReference?` (carries both the playlist-key id via `.id` AND the file-fetch reference); the `.mediaAudio` arms in `stableId`/`reuse`/`makeItemView`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2RevealCost.swift` | `.mediaAudio` is a non-text reveal entry charging `frame.width` (like other media). |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/Network/FetchedMediaResource.swift` | The `.message` media-reference revalidation arm also searches `RichTextMessageAttribute.instantPage.media` (not just `message.media`), so a stale instant-page file reference inside a rich message can recover. |
| rich bubble + send preview | `ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode` passes `message: MessageReference(item.message)`; `ChatSendMessageRichTextPreview` passes `message: nil`. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **The playlist key is message-scoped, NOT webpage-scoped, for rich bubbles.** Every rich message synthesizes its `TelegramMediaWebpage` with the SAME constant id `(namespace: 0, id: 0)` (`ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode`), and `mediaIndex` restarts at 0 per page — so keying playback by `(webpageId, mediaIndex)` (V1's scheme) would make two audio bubbles on screen share/fight playback state (scrubber + play/pause icon). The discriminated `InstantPageMediaPlaylistId.richMessage(messageId)` isolates them. The audio view resolves `renderContext.message?.id` → `.richMessage(messageId)`, else `.instantPage(webpageId:)`; the send preview (no message) takes the webpage fallback — harmless since only one preview is ever on screen. The V1 full-page IV path is byte-identical (always `.instantPage(...)`).
- **`InstantPageMediaPlaylistId` had to become `public`.** It is exposed through `InstantPageMediaPlaylist`'s `public init`, which BrowserUI constructs cross-module; an internal type in a public initializer is a hard Swift compile error (independent of `-warnings-as-errors`). This surfaced only at full-build time — the per-module reasoning didn't catch it.
- **The big control's play/pause comes from OUR playlist, the small overlay's download/progress from the resource status — two separate signals.** The file node (`ChatMessageInteractiveFileNode`) for music keys its play/pause off the **peer-messages** playback model (`messageFileMediaPlaybackStatus` → `peerMessagesMediaPlaylistAndItemId`), which our attribute-embedded audio is NOT part of — so `InstantPageV2AudioContentNode` drives the big `statusNode` `.play`↔`.pause` from **our** `filteredPlaylistState` (keyed by the message-scoped `playlistId` + `InstantPageMediaPlaylistItemId(index:)`) and the small `streamingStatusNode` from `messageMediaFileStatus`. This split (rather than reusing the file node) is why the redesign is a replicated layout, not a hosted `ChatMessageInteractiveFileNode`.
- **Fetch MUST go through the fetch manager, not `freeMediaFileInteractiveFetched`.** `messageMediaFileStatus`'s progress (`.Fetching`) is derived from the fetch manager's `hasEntry` flag; `freeMediaFileInteractiveFetched` bypasses the manager (`hasEntry` stays false), so the overlay would stick on the static download icon and never show the animated ring. The control fetches via `messageMediaFileInteractiveFetched(fetchManager:messageId:messageReference:file:…)`.
- **Tap is a `UITapGestureRecognizer`, never an ASControl** (same invariant as the V1 `InstantPageAudioNode` play button): ASControl `.touchUpInside` is cancelled by the chat `ListView`'s gesture system. The plain `tapView` covers the whole control → `controlTapped` (fetch-when-remote / `togglePlayPause`-when-playing / `play`-else).
- **`InstantPageV2AudioContentNode.updatePresentationData` must refresh EVERYTHING theme/incoming-dependent.** `TextNode` (unlike `ASTextNode`) has no stored `attributedText` — the strings live in `titleAttributedString`/`descriptionAttributedString` and are fed to `TextNode.asyncLayout`. On an in-place theme/direction change `updatePresentationData` rebuilds those strings AND `statusNode.backgroundNodeColor` + `foregroundNodeColor` + `overlayForegroundNodeColor` + `scrubbingNode.updateColors(…)`; missing any leaves a stale-colored control. Font size is `presentationData.chatFontSize.baseDisplaySize` (plain `PresentationData` has no `.fontSize`).
- **Audio is NOT a gallery item.** `InstantPageV2MediaAudioView` does not register in the root media registry (no `didMoveToWindow`/`registerInRootRegistry`) and returns `nil` from `instantPageTransitionNode` / no-ops `instantPageUpdateHiddenMedia` — explicit per-class witnesses, not the protocol-extension default. Its media IS enrolled in `collectMedias`/`allMedias()` so `handleOpenAudioTap` can gather the page's sibling voice/music files for the playlist (matching V1's `mediasFromItems`). The `WrapperRef` weak box breaks the wrapper → node → closure → wrapper retain cycle (the `play` closure captures only the box + value locals, never `self`).
- **Full-width item frame, file-node internal layout.** The `.audio` arm lays the item at `x = 0, width = boundingWidth, height = 44` (the file node's music `normHeight`), NOT inset by `horizontalInset`. The control's internal geometry is copied from the file node's non-thumbnail music branch (Ø44 control at x = 3, `controlAreaWidth = 55`, title at x = 55). Music-only: any voice file renders music-style (no waveform/transcription). No edge-bleed.
- **Audio files fetch via a message reference (the former recipient-fetch risk is resolved).** `InstantPageMediaPlaylistItem.fileReference(_:)` builds `.message(message: messageReference, media: file)` when the playlist carries a **resolvable-id** `MessageReference` (rich bubbles), else the legacy `.webPage(...)` (V1 full-page IV, whose webpage is real). The fetch-reference fallback uses the same `message?.id != nil` test as the playlist-key fallback, so a `.none`-content reference degrades to the webpage path consistently. Because the rich-message file lives in `RichTextMessageAttribute.instantPage.media` (not `message.media`), `FetchedMediaResource.swift`'s `.message` revalidation arm was taught to search the attribute's instant page too — so a **stale** file reference can re-fetch the message and recover (a synthetic-`(0,0)`-webpage reference never could, because that webpage doesn't exist server-side). This also fixes a latent pre-existing bug: instant-page **image** references in rich messages couldn't revalidate either.
- **Fixed a dormant inverted `InstantPagePlaylistLocation.isEqual`** (it returned `false` for equal locations and `true` for unequal — backwards). `areSharedMediaPlaylistsEqual` ANDs the playlist `id` and `location`; it gates only seek-forwarding inside `setPlaylist`, a path the instant-page audio scrubber doesn't take (it uses `playlistControl(.seek)`), so the bug was inert. The corrected equality is safe even though all rich-message locations share the synthetic `(0,0)` webpageId: the `.richMessage(messageId)` **id** (ANDed in) disambiguates different rich-message playlists.

## InstantPage V2 collage & slideshow blocks

`InstantPageBlock.collage` and `.slideshow` (grouped photos/videos with a caption) render in V2 by porting V1. Collage flattens into the existing media-item machinery; slideshow is a dedicated interactive carousel.

**`.collage` is no longer web-IV-only (added 2026-07-08).** The RichText editor's multi-media containers
(a `MediaBlock`/`ChatInputMedia` holding `items.count >= 2` photos/videos with one shared caption — see
`docs/richtext-composer.md` §4 "Inline media") now also emit `.collage` on send/edit/draft, from both the
composer (`ChatInputContentInstantPage`) and the article editor (`RichTextEditorMessageConversion`'s
`InstantPageBuilder`) converters — the first editor/rich-message path to produce a `.collage` block
(needed zero codec work; it was already first-class through Postbox/FlatBuffers/upload). A container of
exactly 1 item still sends the plain `.image`/`.video` block, byte-identical to before.

**`.slideshow` is now editor-produced too (added 2026-07-17).** A multi-media container carries a
`displayMode` (`.mosaic` default / `.slideshow`; mirrored `MediaBlock.displayMode` ↔
`ChatInputMedia.displayMode`, Codable back-compat → `.mosaic`). Both forward converters branch on it:
`.mosaic → .collage`, `.slideshow → .slideshow` (same inner `.image`/`.video` blocks); the reverse
`chatInputBlocks(fromInstantPageBlocks:)` gained a `.slideshow` arm (sharing the collage arm's item
helper) so the mode round-trips on edit. The mode is toggled in the **article editor** via a top-right
button (mosaic↔slideshow); the composer stays mosaic-only. So `.slideshow` is now produced both by real
web Instant View articles and by editor-authored slideshow albums. Design + plan:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-07-17-richtext-media-layout-toggle*`.

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `layoutCollage(...)` — mosaic via `chatMessageBubbleMosaicLayout` (the `MosaicLayout` module, same engine grouped messages use), emitting one existing `.mediaImage`/`.mediaVideo` item per cell. `layoutSlideshow(...)` + the `InstantPageV2SlideshowItem` laid-out item (+ its `frame`/`offsetBy`/`collectMedias` arms). |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2SlideshowView.swift` | The carousel view: a paged `UIScrollView` of `InstantPageImageNode` pages + a `PageControlNode`, with all pages created **eagerly**. |
| `…/InstantPageRenderer.swift` | `InstantPageItemView.instantPageTransitionNode(for:)` / `instantPageUpdateHiddenMedia(_:)` (gallery hooks, nil/no-op defaults); `transitionArgsFor`/`applyHiddenMedia` dispatch through them. The `.slideshow` arms in `InstantPageV2ItemKind`/`stableId`/`reuse`/`makeItemView`. |
| `…/InstantPageV2RevealCost.swift` | `.slideshow` is a non-text reveal entry (collage cells already are, being top-level media items). |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Collage is a flatten, not a container.** `layoutCollage` computes the mosaic, then emits each cell as an ordinary top-level `.mediaImage`/`.mediaVideo` item (cornerRadius 0) into the parent layout — exactly as V1 does (`flattenedItemsWithOrigin`). Consequence: gallery enumeration (`allMedias`), the media registry, hidden-media, the reveal-cost map, and view reuse all handle collage cells **for free**, with no collage-specific code in any of those subsystems. There is **no** `.collage` laid-out item or view.
- **Right-edge collage cells bleed 4pt** (`instantPageV2MediaEdgeBleed`, applied only to `MosaicItemPosition.right` cells) for the same bubble-rounded-clip reason as full-width single media; interior gaps are the mosaic's 1pt spacing; outer corners are rounded by the bubble's `containerNode`.
- **Slideshow IS a container** (it's swipeable), so it gets its own laid-out item + view, unlike collage. Adding the `.slideshow` case to `InstantPageV2LaidOutItem` forces a `.slideshow` arm in every no-`default` switch over it: `frame`, `offsetBy`, `stableId`, `reuse`, `makeItemView`, and the reveal-cost `computeEntries` (plus `collectMedias`, which has a `default` but needs the arm to enumerate slideshow medias for the gallery).
- **Slideshow pages are created eagerly, deviating from V1's lazy central±1 paging.** In a chat bubble a slideshow is a handful of images, so eager creation avoids V1's index bookkeeping and makes the gallery transition source available for **every** page (even off-screen). Height = the tallest image `fitted(boundingWidth × 1200)`; only `.image` inner blocks render (matches V1 — videos become empty pages).
- **The slideshow registers under EVERY contained media index, and re-registers on an in-window rebuild.** Its stableId is positional (`.positional(.slideshow, position)`, not `.media(index)` like the static media views), so it can be reused for a *different* slideshow at the same block position; `rebuildPages()` re-runs `registerMedias()` (guarded by `window != nil`) so the new indices land in the registry. The gallery hooks iterate the live page nodes and match by `InstantPageMedia` identity, so registering one view under N indices is idempotent.
- **The 4 static media views answer the gallery hooks with explicit per-class witnesses, NOT a shared protocol-extension override** — an extension-only implementation is statically dispatched and would silently bind to the nil default when invoked through the `InstantPageItemView`-typed registry wrapper.

## InstantPage V2 media spoiler (revealable dust)

A `pageBlockPhoto`/`pageBlockVideo` (and thus a collage cell) can carry a **spoiler** flag — the medium is
hidden behind an animated "dust" cover until the recipient taps it, mirroring the regular
`MediaSpoilerMessageAttribute` path in `ChatMessageInteractiveMediaNode`. This is how a rich message
(`RichTextMessageAttribute` → InstantPage) carries a media spoiler; the composer-authoring side is in
`docs/richtext-composer.md` §4.

### Where things live

| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| model flag | `InstantPageBlock.image`/`.video` gain `spoiler: Bool` (`SyncCore_InstantPage.swift`); Postbox key `"sp"`, flatBuffers `Models/InstantPageBlock.fbs` `spoiler:bool (id:4)` |
| wire | `ApiUtils/InstantPage.swift` reads/ORs `pageBlockPhoto` `flags.1` / `pageBlockVideo` `flags.2` — **no `TelegramApi` change** (the bit rides the existing `flags` Int32; constructor ids `1759c560`/`7c8fe7b6` unchanged) |
| laid-out item | `InstantPageV2MediaImageItem`/`VideoItem` gain `spoiler: Bool` (`InstantPageV2Layout.swift`); single-media + collage item-constructing cases thread it |
| render | `InstantPageV2MediaViews.swift` — `MediaSpoilerDustOverlay` hosts a `MediaDustNode` (import `InvisibleInkDustNode`) in both `InstantPageV2MediaImageView`/`VideoView` |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **The dust cover is NON-interactive; reveal is driven through the wrapped node's own tap.** The overlay
  (`containerNode` + `dustNode`) is `isUserInteractionEnabled = false`, so taps fall through to the sibling
  `InstantPageImageNode` below it. Each view's `openMedia` closure is **gated**: while `overlay.concealed`,
  the first tap calls `overlay.reveal()` (which sets `concealed = false` synchronously and drives
  `MediaDustNode.tap(at:)` → the wipe animation → the `revealed` callback removes the cover) and returns
  **without** opening the gallery; once revealed, taps fall through to `handleOpenMediaTap` (gallery). This
  mirrors `ExtendedMediaOverlayNode.reveal(animated:)` but with a non-interactive cover instead of an
  interactive button.
- **Reuse resets reveal state by media id.** A positionally-reused media view (`stableId = .media(index)`,
  reconciled through `update(item:)` → `updateSpoiler`) keyed on `EngineMedia.Id`: a different id or
  `spoiler == false` tears down the cover; the same spoiler medium keeps its (possibly already-revealed)
  state — so scrolling can't bleed a stale reveal onto a different photo, and a re-layout of the same photo
  doesn't re-hide it. **No `InstantPageRenderer.reuse(existingView:)` change** was needed — it already routes
  through `update(item:)`.
- **Collage cells inherit spoiler for free.** `layoutCollage` flattens inner `.image`/`.video` into ordinary
  top-level `.mediaImage`/`.mediaVideo` items (see the collage section above), threading each inner block's
  `spoiler` — so an album with one spoiler cell just works, with no collage-specific spoiler code.
- **The long-press-Send options preview** renders through the same `InstantPageV2View`, so a spoiler'd media
  shows the dust cover in the preview bubble automatically.

## InstantPage V2 rich-message video (auto-download & inline autoplay)

Video block media in a **rich message** (`RichTextMessageAttribute` → InstantPage V2, drawn by
`ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode`) now auto-downloads and auto-plays inline like regular chat
media (`ChatMessageInteractiveMediaNode`) — previously it was a static poster + play glyph that only
downloaded/played on tap-to-gallery, and image auto-download ignored per-message settings. The fix is
**layering-safe**: it lives entirely in `InstantPageUI` + the chat bubble, with **no** dependency on
`ChatMessageInteractiveMediaNode` (that would invert the module layering — `InstantPageUI` is a
low-level module also used by web Instant View / `BrowserUI`). HLS inline-range preloading and
live-photo are deliberately **out of scope** (they fall back to tap-to-gallery).

Spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-instantpage-v2-video-autodownload-autoplay-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-instantpage-v2-video-autodownload-autoplay-design.md).
Plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-instantpage-v2-video-autodownload-autoplay.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-instantpage-v2-video-autodownload-autoplay.md).

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` | `InstantPageV2RenderContext` gains 3 policy closures — `shouldAutoDownloadImage`/`shouldAutoDownloadFile`/`shouldAutoplayVideo` (all default `{ _ in false }`). `InstantPageItemView` gains `instantPageUpdateIsVisible(_:)` (default no-op), driven by `updateItemVisibility()` on every `visibilityRect` change (alongside `updateEmojiVisibility`). |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageImageNode.swift` | `init` gains optional `autoDownloadImage`/`autoDownloadFile` overrides (default `nil` ⇒ current V1/web-IV global-settings behavior); the image + image-file fetch gates consult them. The video (`else`) branch stays poster-only. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2MediaViews.swift` | `makeMediaWrapper` forwards the two download overrides. `InstantPageV2MediaVideoView` hosts an inline `UniversalVideoNode`/`NativeVideoContent` (`updateInlineVideo`/`tearDownVideoNode`) layered above the poster. |
| `…/Chat/ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode/…` | Computes the 3 closures from the chat item and sets a real `sourceLocation`. |
| `ChatSendMessageRichTextPreview.swift` | Unchanged — keeps the defaults (`message: nil` + off closures) → static poster. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Policy is computed in the bubble, consumed as booleans in `InstantPageUI`.** The bubble has the
  chat item, so it computes download via `shouldDownloadMediaAutomatically(settings:
  item.controllerInteraction.automaticMediaDownloadSettings, peerType:
  associatedData.automaticDownloadPeerType, networkType: …automaticDownloadNetworkType, authorPeerId:
  message.author?.id, contactsPeerIds: …, media:)` and autoplay via `(file.isAnimated ?
  energyUsageSettings.autoplayGif : .autoplayVideo) && completedResourcePath(file) != nil`.
  `InstantPageUI` never learns chat semantics — it just calls the closures. The closure types mirror the
  existing `imageReference`/`fileReference` split (concrete `TelegramCore` types) because `EngineMedia`'s
  wrap/unwrap helpers are `internal` to `TelegramCore`.
- **Video content id MUST be message-scoped, not webpage-scoped.** Every rich message synthesizes the
  same webpage id `(0,0)`, so keying the player by webpage would make two on-screen rich-message videos
  collide in the universal video manager. `InstantPageV2MediaVideoView` uses the existing
  `NativeVideoContentId.message(UInt32(bitPattern: messageId.id), file.fileId)` — same trap the V2 audio
  port hit (`.richMessage(messageId)`). The inline player is only built when `renderContext.message?.id`
  exists, so the send-preview (nil message) never needs one.
- **Visibility gating has no dead-attach window.** The player's `canAttachContent` is toggled by
  `instantPageUpdateIsVisible` (from the root's `visibilityRect` → `updateItemVisibility`). A player
  built *before* the first visibility tick starts with `canAttachContent = false`, but first display
  always flips `visibilityRect` nil→rect (a *change*) → the tick attaches it. A player built on a *later*
  update (e.g. after a fetch completes, with no visibility change) is seeded `canAttachContent =
  self.localIsVisible`, which is already true for an on-screen view. Both orderings attach.
- **Auto-download is decoupled from autoplay (fixes the "never downloads" gap).** When
  `shouldAutoDownloadFile(file)` is true the video bytes are fetched (once per media id, via
  `freeMediaFileInteractiveFetched` with the render-context `.message` `fileReference`) **even if
  autoplay is off** — so a rich-message video prefetches per settings instead of only on tap.
  `videoFetchMediaId` dedups; the `MetaDisposable` `set()` cancels a stale fetch on media switch and is
  disposed in `deinit`.
- **Reuse & spoiler.** Positional reuse keeps the player only when `videoNodeMediaId == mediaId`
  (else teardown + rebuild); a concealed spoiler cover suppresses the player (`wantAutoplay =
  shouldAutoplayVideo && !concealed`), and the spoiler reveal path re-runs `updateInlineVideo` so
  autoplay starts after the dust clears. Gallery transition hides the player via
  `instantPageUpdateHiddenMedia`.
- **Collage cells inherit this for free** — `.collage` flattens into ordinary `.mediaVideo` items, so
  each cell is an `InstantPageV2MediaVideoView` with no collage-specific code.

## InstantPage V2 text item height (true font line box)

`layoutTextItem` (`InstantPageV2Layout.swift`) sizes a `.text` item to the **true font line height**, not the cap box. A single-line item measures exactly `fontAscent + fontDescentBelowBaseline` (`A + D`); the old behavior was the cap box `fontLineHeight = floor(fontAscent + fontDescent)` (`A − D`).

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Two edits in `layoutTextItem`:** the line stack starts at `lineBoxTopInset = max(0, fontAscent − fontLineHeight)` (was `0`), and the returned height is `lines.last.frame.maxY + extraDescent + fontDescentBelowBaseline` (the `+ fontDescentBelowBaseline` contains the last line's descender). Net: every text item grows ~`(A − L) + D` (~8pt @17pt) and its glyphs draw ~`lineBoxTopInset` (~4pt) lower within their box; the page grows.
- **Per-line frames stay the cap box** (`height = lineAscent = fontLineHeight`). Only the stack's starting origin moves and the total is padded — so the baseline is still drawn at each line frame's `maxY`, inter-line advance (`lineAscent + fontLineSpacing + extraDescent`) is unchanged, and decorations / inline attachments / `characterRect` / the reveal mask (all line-frame-relative) translate consistently.
- **`lineBoxTopInset` is exact, NOT pixel-snapped** — it is an intra-item line offset; crispness rides on the item's own pixel-snapped frame origin (intra-item line positions may already be fractional, e.g. after a non-integral `extraDescent`).
- **Formulas / tall inline content still inflate** via `lineAscent`/`extraDescent`; the `"\u{200b}"`+anchors `height = 0` case is preserved.
- **Inline custom emoji are sized to ≈ the line box** so they fit the taller box rather than overflowing it (see "Inline custom emoji").

## Inline custom emoji (RichText.textCustomEmoji)

`RichText.textCustomEmoji(fileId:alt:)` renders an inline **animated** custom emoji inside rich-data bubbles. Covers API parsing, Postbox + FlatBuffers serialization, and display in the InstantPage V2 renderer; the emoji participates in the streaming reveal above. (The **send / edit / copy / paste** round-trip that produces `.textCustomEmoji` from typed markdown is a separate section below: "Custom emoji in markdown messages".)

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/SyncCore/SyncCore_RichText.swift` | Enum case `textCustomEmoji(fileId: Int64, alt: String)` + Postbox coding (discriminator 17, keys `ce.f`/`ce.a`), `==`, `plainText` (returns `alt`), and FlatBuffers codec. |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/FlatSerialization/Models/RichText.fbs` | FlatBuffers schema — `RichText_CustomEmoji` union member + table. **Source of truth**; the Bazel `flatc` genrule regenerates `*_generated.swift` at build time (the checked-in `Sources/*_generated.swift` is stale). |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/ApiUtils/RichText.swift` | `Api.RichText.textCustomEmoji` ⇄ Swift, lossless both ways. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageTextItem.swift` (`attributedStringForRichText`) | Emits a single placeholder char carrying `ChatTextInputAttributes.customEmoji` (a `ChatTextInputTextCustomEmojiAttribute`) + a `CTRunDelegate` sized to the font line height (`font.ascender − font.descender + 4·pointSize/17` ≈ 24pt @17pt). |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` (line-breaker) | Collects per-line `InstantPageTextLine.emojiItems`; overwrites each placeholder char's `characterRect` with a full cell (`width = itemSize`) so it feeds the reveal cost map. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` (`InstantPageV2View`) | Owns the `InlineStickerItemLayer`s: `updateInlineEmoji` (create/reuse/remove/position), `updateEmojiReveal` (reveal-driven pop-in), `updateEmojiVisibility` + `propagateVisibilityRect`. Layers attach to each text view's `emojiContainerView`. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **flatc casing/`required` gotchas.** Edit `RichText.fbs`, not the generated Swift. Scalars (`long`) cannot be `(required)` — only strings/tables can. A union member `RichText_CustomEmoji` generates the Swift enum case `.richtextCustomemoji` (everything after the suffix's first letter is lowercased); the table type stays `TelegramCore_RichText_CustomEmoji` and field accessors keep `.fbs` casing (`value.fileId`). See the `flatbuffers-codegen` memory.
- **`ChatTextInputTextCustomEmojiAttribute` is reused end-to-end** (display layer ⇄ layout model). The attribute is written to the placeholder in `attributedStringForRichText` and read back by the V2 line-breaker under the SAME key (`ChatTextInputAttributes.customEmoji`); `InlineStickerItemLayer.init` consumes it directly and resolves the file lazily from `fileId`.
- **Emoji participates in the streaming reveal.** Its placeholder char's `characterRect` is overwritten to a full cell (width = `itemSize`), so the width-based cost map charges it like other content. `updateEmojiReveal` pops the layer in (alpha 0→1 + scale) when `charIndexInItem < currentRevealCharacterCount`; unrevealed → opacity 0.
- **Inline emoji/images are CENTERED on the font line box, NOT baseline-aligned, and do NOT inflate the line.** The line-breaker keeps `lineAscent = fontLineHeight` (only formulas grow it) and places each attachment at `baselineY − fontLineHeight/2 − size/2`, so it bleeds symmetrically about the line box instead of doubling the line height and shoving the text baseline down (the prior `lineAscent = emoji.size` behavior was a regression from V1 `layoutTextItemWithString`, which centers via `(fontLineHeight − imageHeight)/2`). Custom emoji are sized to ≈ the line box (`size = font.ascender − font.descender + 4·pointSize/17`) so they fit the true-font-height item box (see "InstantPage V2 text item height") with minimal bleed. Mirrors the chat `InteractiveTextComponent`. The cell's `characterRect` is centered the same way (`y = fontLineHeight/2 − size/2`) so the reveal mask (`renderer: y = minY + lineAscent − rect.maxY`) tracks it; a tall attachment grows `extraDescent` so the next line isn't overlapped. Three things must stay in lockstep: the display frame, the `characterRect`, and `extraDescent`.
- **Inline-attachment x must be the LEADING edge, computed RTL-safely via `v2LeadingOffsetForRange` (`InstantPageV2Layout.swift`).** An attachment's left edge is `min(CTLineGetOffsetForStringIndex(start), CTLineGetOffsetForStringIndex(end))` — NOT the bare start-index offset. `CTLineGetOffsetForStringIndex` at the start index returns the glyph's LEFT edge in LTR but its RIGHT edge in RTL (string index increases leftward), so the old single-offset form (`…, range.location, nil`) shoved emoji/images/formulas ~one advance (≈ the attachment width) too far right on RTL lines — e.g. an emoji in an Arabic thinking-block line, while the CoreText-drawn text stayed correct. The helper mirrors `Display.TextNode`'s `addEmbeddedItem` (incl. directional-boundary secondary-offset handling) and the strikethrough/underline/marked/spoiler decorations in this same file, which already used the `min`/`abs` form. For pure-LTR lines it returns exactly the start-index offset, so LTR is byte-identical. Applies to all 5 attachment sites: the emoji/image/formula display frames AND the emoji/image `characterRect` (reveal mask). The widths stay the fixed `size`/`rendered.size` values (the run-delegate advance), only the x is corrected.
- **Layers sit ABOVE the reveal mask.** They attach to `InstantPageV2TextView.emojiContainerView` (a sibling above `renderContainer`), NOT inside it — so the reveal mask wipes glyphs while emoji pop in independently. Adding a CTRunDelegate-glyph to the mask would clip-wipe them instead.
- **Layers are owned by `InstantPageV2View`, not the text view.** Keyed by `InlineStickerItemLayer.Key(id: fileId, index: occurrence)`. The pageView is now REUSED across `stableVersion` bumps (see streaming section), so the inline-emoji dict PERSISTS across chunks; `updateInlineEmoji` prunes stale keys (emoji whose blocks have been removed) and creates/repositions layers for new or unchanged emoji each update pass.
- **`visibilityRect` gates looping; `nil` means "not visible".** The bubble's `visibility` override pushes a full-width sub-rect to the root `pageView.visibilityRect`, re-pushed in the apply closure after `pageView.frame` is set. `propagateVisibilityRect` converts the rect into each nested V2View's coordinate space (`self.convert(_:to:)`) for details bodies / table cells+title, fanning out via each child's `didSet`.
- **CTRunDelegate extent buffers must be freed.** Every inline-attachment arm (`.image`/`.formula`/`.textCustomEmoji`) in `attributedStringForRichText` allocates an `extentBuffer`; the `dealloc` callback must `deallocate()` it (it re-runs per layout pass).

## RichText entity cases (mention / hashtag / bot command / bank card / auto link)

`RichText.textMention`, `.textMentionName(text:peerId:)`, `.textHashtag`, `.textCashtag`, `.textBotCommand`, `.textBankCard`, `.textAutoUrl`, `.textAutoEmail`, `.textAutoPhone` render the message-entity flavors of rich text inside rich-data bubbles with full tap interaction mirroring `ChatMessageTextBubbleContentNode`. Covers API parsing, Postbox + FlatBuffers serialization, display, and tap routing. (`textDate`/`textSpoiler` remain unimplemented — `.plain("")`.)

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/SyncCore/SyncCore_RichText.swift` | The 9 enum cases (each wraps `text: RichText`; `textMentionName` adds raw `peerId: Int64`) + Postbox coding (discriminators 18–26, wrapped text under key `"t"`, mention-name peerId under `"mn.p"`), `==`, `plainText`, FlatBuffers codec. |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/FlatSerialization/Models/RichText.fbs` | Union members + tables (`RichText_MentionName` adds `peerId:long`). Source of truth — same flatc gotchas as the custom-emoji section above. |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/ApiUtils/RichText.swift` | `Api.RichText` ⇄ Swift, lossless. `textMentionName` carries `userId` ⇄ `peerId`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageTextItem.swift` (`attributedStringForRichText`) | Display: auto url/email/phone reuse the `InstantPageUrlItem` (`url:`) path; the six entity cases push `.link(false)`, recurse, then attach the matching `TelegramTextAttributes.*` key over the produced range. |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Components/Chat/ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode/...` | Tap routing: `entityForTapLocation` reads the attribute dict at the tapped point; `entityTapContent` maps keys → `ChatMessageBubbleContentTapAction.Content`. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Display attaches the same `TelegramTextAttributes.*` keys the chat text bubble uses; the bubble reads them back.** Contract: `textMention`→`PeerTextMention` (String); `textMentionName`→`PeerMention` (`TelegramPeerMention`, peerId built as `EnginePeer.Id(namespace: Namespaces.Peer.CloudUser, …)` — `InstantPageTextItem` imports TelegramCore but NOT Postbox, so bare `PeerId` is out of scope); `textHashtag` AND `textCashtag`→`Hashtag` (`TelegramHashtag`; no dedicated cashtag key/tap-action — the leading `$` distinguishes them); `textBotCommand`→`BotCommand`; `textBankCard`→`BankCard`. Auto url/email/phone go through the URL path (`mailto:`/`tel:`/raw), NOT an entity key.
- **`linkSelectionRects` and the bubble tap path check all six interactive keys** (URL + the five entity keys), not just URL, so press-highlight and the link-loading shimmer cover entities too.
- **Rich-data text selection must reach a line's trailing edge.** This is general to rich-data selection, not just entities: `InstantPageTextItem.attributesAtPoint(_:orNearest:)`'s `orNearest: true` (selection-drag) path returns `line.range.upperBound` (via `CTLineGetStringRange`) when the point is at/past `lineFrame.maxX`. `TextSelectionNode` uses that index as the **exclusive** upper bound, so clamping to the last character's index — as the `orNearest: false` hit-testing path correctly does — would leave the last character/item of every line unselectable. Mirrors `Display.TextNode`. Do not collapse the two `orNearest` paths back together.

## Markdown send: entity vs. rich detection

On message send, the app auto-decides: if the typed markdown maps onto the regular message-entity set (bold/italic/code/strikethrough/spoiler/links/blockquote/fenced-code) it sends a **normal message** via the existing entity path; if it contains structure the entity set can't represent it sends a **rich message** (`RichTextMessageAttribute` carrying an `InstantPage`, rendered by `ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode`). Always-on (no flag). **Effective rich triggers are headings, lists, and tables only.**

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/BrowserMarkdown.swift` | The classifier `richMarkdownAttributeIfNeeded(context:text:)` (pre-filter `markdownMightNeedRichLayout` → parse via existing `inputRichTextAttributeFromText` → block inspection `instantPageNeedsRichLayout`/`blockIsEntityExpressible`/`richTextIsEntityExpressible`), plus the markdown→InstantPage conversion (`markdownWebpage`, `markdownBlocks(from:)`, `markdownBlocksWithGeneratedAnchors`). |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Sources/ChatControllerNode.swift` (`sendCurrentMessage`, ~line 4860) | The gate: `if !isSpecialChatContents, let attribute = richMarkdownAttributeIfNeeded(context:, text: effectiveInputText.string)` routes to the rich branch; the unchanged `else` is the entity path. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Boundary rule:** send rich iff the parse yields an `InstantPageBlock` with no entity equivalent. Entity-expressible whitelist (→ normal): `.paragraph`, `.preformatted`, `.blockQuote` (empty caption), `.anchor`, `.unsupported`, **and `.divider`** (`---` is too common in casual text to trigger rich). **`.formula` (block and inline) DOES trigger rich**, gated by strict math detection (see "Formulas trigger rich messages" below) so casual `$` usage (`$5-$10`, `$FOO=$BAR`) stays plain. So effective triggers = headings, lists, tables, formulas.
- **Approach A (parse-then-inspect):** the classifier reuses the real parser, so "what triggers rich" can't drift from "what the rich renderer shows." `markdownMightNeedRichLayout` is a cheap necessary-condition over-approximation — it may over-trigger a parse but must **never** false-negative. It detects `#`, list markers, dash-lines (`-{1,}`, which also catches setext-H2 underlines → heading blocks), `\n=` (setext H1), `|`, `![`, and math delimiters `$`/`\(`/`\[` (formulas now trigger rich; the strict detection step decides whether a `$` run is actually math).
- **Chat vs. document path = `file == nil` / `context.documentURL == nil`.** `inputRichTextAttributeFromText` passes `file: nil`; the document-attachment path passes a real file. Two chat-only behaviors key off this: (a) generated heading anchors are **skipped** (`markdownBlocksWithGeneratedAnchors` runs only for documents — anchors exist for intra-document `#slug` links and otherwise prepend a spurious invisible `.anchor` block per heading); (b) a level-1 `#` heading maps to `.heading(text:, level: 1)`, not `.title` (the document/article-title treatment). H2–H6 → `.heading(level: 2…6)` for both paths. This converter only ever emits `.title` (H1-doc) or `.heading` — never `.header`/`.subheader`.
- **The classifier is fed the RAW `effectiveInputText.string`**, not the post-`convertMarkdownToAttributes` `inputText`, so inline `**bold**` survives into the rich render. The entity branch still uses the converted `inputText`.
- **Bypassed for `.customChatContents`** (business links / quick replies) via `isSpecialChatContents`. The compose/send gate lives here; **editing has its own symmetric re-classification** — see "Editing rich messages" below.
- **Transmission:** `RichTextMessageAttribute` → `Api.InputRichMessage` via `messages.sendMessage(richMessage:)` (flag bit 23, `StandaloneSendMessage.swift`); recipients reconstruct it from the incoming `richMessage` field (`StoreMessage_Telegram.swift`). The rich branch sends `text: ""` + the attribute, nils `mediaReference` (no separate webpage preview), and bypasses 4096-char chunking. iOS < 15 / oversize markdown → `inputRichTextAttributeFromText` returns nil → entity path (which chunks).

## Editing rich messages (InstantPage → markdown)

Rich messages (`RichTextMessageAttribute`, `text == ""`) are made editable by reconstructing markdown source from the stored `InstantPage`, populating the editor with it, and re-classifying on save — the inverse of the send path above. Always-on (no flag). Images/videos are out of scope (skipped by the converter).

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/InstantPageToMarkdown.swift` | `markdownStringFromInstantPage(_:)` — the inverse converter (block + inline + list + table + escaping). Pure, best-effort, never fails. |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Sources/Chat/ChatControllerLoadDisplayNode.swift` | `setupEditMessage`: rich message → reconstruct markdown into the edit field. `editMessage` (save): re-classify the raw input, route rich-or-plain. |
| `submodules/TelegramStringFormatting/Sources/InstantPagePreviewText.swift` | `previewText()` extensions (`RichText`/`InstantPage*`) — one-line plaintext previews. |
| `submodules/TelegramStringFormatting/Sources/MessageContentKind.swift` | `messageContentKind` returns `.text(instantPage.previewText())` for rich, cascading to all preview surfaces. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **The converter emits CommonMark inline, NOT the entity-regex dialect.** `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `~~strike~~`, `[text](url)` — because re-send re-parses the text through the *rich* path (`richMarkdownAttributeIfNeeded` → `NSAttributedString(markdown:)`, Apple CommonMark), not `convertMarkdownToAttributes` (whose dialect is `__italic__`/`||spoiler||`). The two parsers disagree on `__`/`*`; the rich round-trip is the contract.
- **Re-classify every edit (edit ≡ send).** `editMessage` runs the same `richMarkdownAttributeIfNeeded` on the edit field's attributed text (so reattached custom emoji round-trip — see the custom-emoji section). Rich → `pendingUpdateMessageManager.add(text: "", entities: nil, richText: attr, …)`; else the unchanged plain path. So normal→rich (add a table) and rich→plain (drop all triggers) both work. Bypassed for `.customChatContents`.
- **Change-detection compares the rich attribute.** The save guard adds `currentRichText != richTextAttribute` (rich branch — skips no-op rich edits) and `currentRichText != nil` (plain branch — so rich→plain still saves even when `text.string` looks unchanged). `RichTextMessageAttribute` is `Equatable` on `instantPage`.
- **The `text.length == 0` early-return guard is safe for rich.** `convertMarkdownToAttributes` only rewrites inline tokens, never strips `#`/`-`/`|`, so a rich message's markdown source stays non-empty and passes; the rich branch then sends `text: ""`.
- **Known limitation:** a rich→plain edit that leaves only inline-formatted text loses `*italic*` (the entity path recognizes only `__…__`). Rare edge; the rich round-trip contract holds.
- **`previewText()` lives in TelegramStringFormatting, not TextFormat/TelegramCore.** It will gain a `strings: PresentationStrings` param (to localize the `"Photo"`/`"Video"`/`"Table"` placeholders), so it must sit in a UI-string module — `messageContentKind`/`descriptionStringForMessage` (same module) already take `strings:`. Teaching `messageContentKind` about rich cascades the preview to the edit accessory panel, reply/pinned panels, and forward preview in one place (those surfaces need no individual change).

## Copying rich messages as markdown (whole message + partial selection)

Rich messages (`RichTextMessageAttribute`, `text == ""`) are copyable as markdown two ways: the context-menu **Copy** action copies the whole message; a **text selection** inside the rich-data bubble copies just the selected range. Both reconstruct markdown that mirrors the edit round-trip (`markdownStringFromInstantPage`). Always-on.

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Sources/ChatInterfaceStateContextMenus.swift` | Whole-message Copy. Computes `richMessageMarkdown` from the message's `RichTextMessageAttribute.instantPage` (after `let message = messages[0]`), opens the Copy gate with `richMessageMarkdown != nil`, and short-circuits `copyTextWithEntities` to `storeMessageTextInPasteboard(markdown, entities: nil)`. |
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/InstantPageToMarkdown.swift` | `markdownStringFromInstantPage` — the block-tree → markdown converter (also used by the edit round-trip). Blocks joined by `\n\n`; nested blockquotes via recursive `> ` wrapping. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageTextItem.swift` | `InstantPageMarkdownBlockContext` (`kind` + `quoteDepth`) and the `markdownContext: InstantPageMarkdownBlockContext?` field on `InstantPageTextItem`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `stampMarkdownContext`/`bumpQuoteDepth`; stamps `markdownContext` during layout (heading/title/code/list/blockQuote/`layoutQuoteText`/table-cell). |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageMultiTextAdapter.swift` | `markdownForRange(_ range: NSRange)` + the private attributed-substring→inline-markdown converter `inlineMarkdown(from:)`. |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Components/Chat/ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode/.../ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode.swift` | Intercepts `.copy` in the `TextSelectionNode` `performAction` closure: `textSelectionNode.getSelection()` → `adapter.markdownForRange(range)` → stores as plain `NSAttributedString(string:)`. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **The V2 layout discards block role.** A `.text` layout item from an `H2` heading is byte-identical to a body paragraph — heading level and the title category are dropped with no back-reference to the source `InstantPageBlock`. Precise structural markdown for a *selection* therefore requires stamping `markdownContext` at layout time (lists/code/tables/details are structurally recoverable; **heading level and `.title` are not**, so they MUST be stamped). Plain paragraphs stay `nil` (≡ plain).
- **`quoteDepth` is orthogonal to `kind`** so a heading/list/code line inside a blockquote round-trips (e.g. `> ## Title`). `bumpQuoteDepth` lifts a quote's children by 1; nested quotes accumulate. `layoutQuoteText` (single-paragraph blockquote fast path AND `.pullQuote`) bumps once — it is never reached by the multi-block recursion, so no double-count.
- **A blockquote is exploded into one text item per line.** `markdownForRange` must re-coalesce a run of consecutive `quoteDepth > 0` segments into ONE `\n`-joined block (each line prefixed at its own depth); otherwise every quote line becomes its own block separated by a blank line. Code/table/list runs are likewise coalesced (one fence; one pipe table; one tight list).
- **Both converters emit compact nested-quote markers (`>>`, not `> >`).** Selection: `String(repeating: ">", count: depth) + " "`. Whole-message: when wrapping a line that already starts with `>`, prepend a bare `>`. Keep the two in sync.
- **Inline markdown is read from display attributes, not the RichText tree.** `inlineMarkdown` inspects the slice's `UIFont` (bold/italic/mono — font-based, no symbolic-trait flag for named fonts), `.strikethroughStyle`, and `TelegramTextAttributes.URL` (→ `InstantPageUrlItem.url`, angle-bracketed if it contains `(`/`)`/space). Custom-emoji placeholders now emit the `[<alt>](tg://emoji?id=…)` marker from the display attribute's `fileId` (alt is best-effort — the display placeholder may be a bare space; see the custom-emoji round-trip section).
- **`.copy` stores plain text.** Passing `NSAttributedString(string: markdown)` through the existing `performTextSelectionAction(.copy)` path (`storeAttributedTextInPasteboard`) generates no entities, so the literal `**`/`#`/`>`/`|` survive. The whole-message Copy uses `storeMessageTextInPasteboard(_, entities: nil)` directly.
- **Fidelity caveats (intentional):** custom emoji are now preserved as `[<alt>](tg://emoji?id=…)` markers (selection copy uses a best-effort alt — see the custom-emoji round-trip section below); ordered list + checkbox loses the ordinal (`-` wins); a partial table selection emits touched cells as rows (no forced header `---` separator); block prefixes apply to the whole touched line on a mid-line selection (correct markdown).

## Custom emoji in markdown messages (send + edit/copy/paste round-trip)

Custom emoji typed into the compose field survive when a message is sent as a **rich** message (heading/list/table/formula), rendering as `RichText.textCustomEmoji` (the display side is the "Inline custom emoji" section above). The carrier across Apple's CommonMark parser is a shared markdown-link marker `[<alt>](tg://emoji?id=<fileId>)`, used identically by the forward (send) and reverse (edit/copy/paste) paths so encode and decode cannot drift. Always-on. **Scope: only rich messages — a custom emoji alone never forces a rich message** (it stays on the entity path as a `.CustomEmoji` entity, the pre-existing behavior).

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TextFormat/Sources/CustomEmojiMarkdownMarker.swift` | The marker format — single source of truth: `customEmojiMarkdownURL(fileId:)`, `parseCustomEmojiFileId(fromMarkdownURL:)`, `escapeCustomEmojiMarkdownAlt(_:)`, and `chatInputTextWithReattachedCustomEmoji(_:)` (markers → live `customEmoji` attributes). In TextFormat so both BrowserUI and InstantPageUI can import it. |
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/BrowserMarkdown.swift` | Forward: `markdownSourceInjectingCustomEmojiMarkers` rewrites each `customEmoji` run into the marker; `richMarkdownAttributeIfNeeded(context:attributedText:)` (signature changed from `text:`); the marker-URL intercept in `markdownInlineContent` → `.textCustomEmoji`. |
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/InstantPageToMarkdown.swift` | Reverse (whole-message copy + edit reconstruction): `.textCustomEmoji` → emit the marker. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageMultiTextAdapter.swift` | Reverse (text-selection copy): emit the marker from the display attribute's `fileId` (alt best-effort). |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Sources/ChatControllerNode.swift`, `…/Chat/ChatMessageDisplaySendMessageOptions.swift` | Send + send-options-preview call sites pass the `NSAttributedString` (`effectiveInputText` / `textInputView.attributedText`); the rich send now passes `inlineStickers`. |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Sources/Chat/ChatControllerLoadDisplayNode.swift` | Edit-load (`setupEditMessage`) reattaches markers via `chatInputTextWithReattachedCustomEmoji`; edit-save (`editMessage`) re-classifies the attributed edit text. |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Components/Chat/ChatTextInputPanelNode/Sources/ChatTextInputPanelNode.swift` | Paste (`chatInputTextNodeShouldPaste`) reattaches plain-text markdown markers → live emoji. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **One shared marker, one set of helpers.** All emit sites (forward normalize, reverse copy/edit, selection copy) use `customEmojiMarkdownURL` + `escapeCustomEmojiMarkdownAlt`; the forward intercept and both reattach sites use `parseCustomEmojiFileId`. The marker is internal/transient — it exists only in the rich-conversion source string and on the clipboard, never persisted as a URL entity.
- **CommonMark preserves the `tg://emoji?id=N` link URL verbatim** under the `NSLink` attribute (spike-verified). `markdownLink`'s `as? NSURL` branch returns `url.absoluteString`, which `parseCustomEmojiFileId` matches by strict prefix. Negative (signed Int64) file ids survive too (the reattach regex is `(-?\d+)`).
- **Scope guard is structural.** `markdownSourceInjectingCustomEmojiMarkers` works on a LOCAL copy — `effectiveInputText` is never mutated. A marker is an entity-expressible link, so an emoji-only message classifies not-rich (`markdownMightNeedRichLayout` finds no `#`/`|`/`![`/`$`/list tokens) and takes the entity path; the untouched `customEmoji` attribute becomes a `.CustomEmoji` entity.
- **`richMarkdownAttributeIfNeeded` now takes `attributedText: NSAttributedString`** (was `text: String`); it normalizes to the marker'd source internally, then calls the unchanged `inputRichTextAttributeFromText(text:)`. All three call sites (send, edit-save, send-options preview) pass the attributed string.
- **Edit-load AND paste reattach to live attributes; copy stays textual.** `setupEditMessage` and `chatInputTextNodeShouldPaste` run `chatInputTextWithReattachedCustomEmoji` so the field shows the animated emoji, not raw token text. The paste branch is guarded by `.contains("tg://emoji?id=")` AND `reattached.string != plainText`, and runs only after the rich pasteboard types miss — `private.telegramtext`/RTF already decode the indexed `tg://emoji?id=<id>&t=<n>` RTF-link form via `chatInputStateStringFromRTF`. `previewText()` is unchanged (keeps the alt glyph).
- **Empty alt → a space.** CommonMark drops `[](url)` (no run carries the link attribute), which would silently lose the emoji; every emit site and the reattach substitute a space when the alt is empty.
- **Rich send attaches `inlineStickers`** (was `[:]`) + bubble-up packs, so the local store has the files. **OPEN runtime risk:** the wire send uses `Api.InputRichMessage.documents: nil` (`apiInputRichMessage()` in `SyncCore_RichTextMessageAttribute.swift`), so recipient rendering depends on the server back-filling `documents` from the embedded `documentId` — UNVERIFIED. If recipients see only the fallback glyph, populate `documents:` there.
- **Accepted limitations:** edit-load reattaches with `file: nil` (renders via lazy fileId resolution, but the premium-emoji gate is bypassed on edit); an alt containing a literal `]` won't reattach on edit-load (cosmetic — re-save still parses it); `parseCustomEmojiFileId` (strict prefix) vs `Pasteboard.swift`'s `URLComponents` parse could drift if the marker format ever changes.

## Formulas trigger rich messages (strict math detection)

`$…$`/`$$…$$` (and `\(…\)`/`\[…\]`) math triggers a rich message, gated by a
strict boundary rule so casual `$` stays plain. Inverse companion of the
markdown-send gate above.

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Inline `$…$`/`$$…$$` detection requires a 4-way boundary** (in `markdownReplacingInlineFormulas`, `BrowserMarkdown.swift`): outer side of each delimiter = line edge OR non-alphanumeric; inner side = non-whitespace; opener/closer `$`-counts must match (1 or 2). This is what rejects `$5-$10`/`$FOO=$BAR`/`cost$5$total` (alphanumeric outer) while keeping `$x$`, `($x$)`, `the answer is $x$.`. The outer check is the addition over a plain "no-space-inside" rule.
- **Block `$$` detection** (`markdownBlockFormulaReplacement`): single-line `$$…$$` requires an exact `$$` opener (not `$$$`) and trailing whitespace only; multi-line requires a **bare** `$$` opener line. `$$x$$ trailing text` falls through to the inline rule. The `\[…\]` opener path is unchanged and exempt from these `$$`-only guards.
- **Detection is shared with the document path; the gate is chat-only.** `markdownPreparedSource` (detection) runs for both chat and document attachments. The triggers (`richTextIsEntityExpressible`/`blockIsEntityExpressible` → `.formula` is non-expressible; `$`/`\(`/`\[` in `markdownMightNeedRichLayout`) are read only by the chat classifier `richMarkdownAttributeIfNeeded`.

## InstantPageListItem task-list checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`)

`InstantPageListItem` carries a first-class `checked: Bool?` — the **third** associated value of `.text(RichText, String?, Bool?)` / `.blocks([InstantPageBlock], String?, Bool?)`, orthogonal to the ordered-list `num` — representing a GitHub-style task-list checkbox. `nil` = not a checkbox item, `false` = unchecked, `true` = checked. Covers markdown parse, Postbox + FlatBuffers serialization, Telegram API transmission, display (V1 + V2), the edit round-trip, and previews.

Spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-27-instantpage-list-checkbox-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-27-instantpage-list-checkbox-design.md). Plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-instantpage-list-checkbox.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-instantpage-list-checkbox.md).

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/SyncCore/SyncCore_InstantPage.swift` | The `checked: Bool?` enum payload; Postbox coding (key `"ck"`, tri-state Int32); `==`; FlatBuffers codec. Internal tri-state helpers `checkedFromTriState`/`triState(fromChecked:)`. |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/FlatSerialization/Models/InstantPageBlock.fbs` | `checkState:int32 (id: 2)` on `InstantPageListItem_Text` + `_Blocks`. **Source of truth**; the Bazel `flatc` genrule regenerates the Swift (checked-in `*_generated.swift` is stale). |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/ApiUtils/InstantPage.swift` | `checked` / `num` accessors; reads & writes the API `checkbox`=flags.0 / `checked`=flags.1 bits via `checkedFromApiFlags` / `apiFlags(fromChecked:)` across all four list-item types. |
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/BrowserMarkdown.swift` | Forward parse: `markdownTaskListMarker` detects `[ ]`/`[x]`/`[X]`; the result routes into `checked` (NOT `num`). |
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/InstantPageToMarkdown.swift` | Reverse: emits `- [ ] ` / `- [x] ` from `item.checked` for the edit round-trip. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | V2 detection via `item.checked`; `.checklist(checked:colors:)` marker carrying `InstantPageV2CheckboxColors`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` | V2 marker view (`InstantPageV2ListMarkerView`) hosts a real `CheckNode`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageLayout.swift` | V1 detection via `item.checked` (renders the existing `InstantPageChecklistMarkerItem`). |
| `submodules/TelegramStringFormatting/Sources/InstantPagePreviewText.swift` | `previewText()` renders a `☐`/`☑︎` glyph + body for checkbox items. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **`checked` is orthogonal to `num`.** The API keeps `checkbox`/`checked` as flags **separate from the list number**, so an ordered item can be both numbered AND a checkbox. This is exactly why the first-class field replaced an earlier sentinel-string-in-`num` prototype (which could not represent both). No `\u{001f}tg-md-task:*` sentinel remains anywhere.
- **API bits are `checkbox`=flags.0, `checked`=flags.1 on ALL FOUR list-item constructors** (`pageListItemText`/`Blocks` and `pageListOrderedItemText`/`Blocks`, in and out — `pageListItemText#2f58683c`, `pageListOrderedItemText#cd3ea036`, etc.). The iOS `Api.*` layer exposes only `flags: Int32`; mask the bits (`apiFlags(fromChecked:)` / `checkedFromApiFlags`). Because state rides the flags (not the text), it survives the server round-trip for sender + recipients — **including the sender's own send-confirmation echo** (`applyUpdateMessage` replaces local attributes with the server's reconstruction, `ApplyUpdateMessage.swift`).
- **Tri-state persistence `0=nil, 1=unchecked, 2=checked`** in BOTH Postbox (key `"ck"`, decoded with `decodeInt32ForKey(orElse: 0)`) and FlatBuffers (`checkState:int32`, default 0). Absent/0 → `nil`, so pre-existing stored pages decode unchanged.
- **Detection reads `item.checked != nil`** in both layout engines (was `instantPageTaskListMarkerState(item.num)`); the V2 marker kind is `.checklist(checked: item.checked == true, colors:)`. The empty-blocks `.blocks → .text(.plain(" "), num, checked)` promotion must carry `checked` through, not drop it.
- **V2 `CheckNode` is hosted directly in a plain `UIView`**, not an ASDisplayNode tree, so `checkNode.displaysAsynchronously = false` is set to avoid a first-draw blank flash. (The V2 pageView is now REUSED across streaming chunks via stable-id diffing — see the AI streaming section; `CheckNode` views survive across chunks as long as their list item is present.) `InstantPageV2CheckboxColors` (background←`panelAccentColor`, stroke←`pageBackgroundColor`, border←`controlColor`) is carried on the `.checklist` payload and mirrors the V1 `instantPageChecklistMarkerTheme`.
- **Forward parser keeps `[ ]` detection but routes to `checked`.** `markdownApplyTaskListMarker`/`markdownStrippingTaskListMarker`/`markdownTaskListMarker` still strip the marker from the item text; the state flows into `checked` while ordered items keep their real `"\(ordinal)"` number. The reverse converter emits lowercase `[x]` / `[ ]`, which the forward `hasPrefix` guards re-parse — that is the round-trip contract.
- **The enum-arity change is compile-enforced.** Adding the third associated value broke every `.text`/`.blocks` construction/destructure; the full build is the completeness gate. Read-only consumers outside the core set exist (`BrowserInstantPageContent.swift`, `CachedFaqInstantPage.swift`) — grep `\.(text|blocks)\(` repo-wide when touching the enum again.

### Tap-to-toggle (editable rich messages)

Task-list checkboxes in a rendered rich message are **interactive when the message is editable**: tapping one flips it and persists the change by editing the message.

Where things live:

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/InstantPageCheckboxToggle.swift` | Pure transform `InstantPage.togglingCheckbox(at: [Int], to: Bool) -> InstantPage` — rebuilds the block tree following a structural path and flips the target list item's `checked` (no-op on an unresolvable/non-checkbox path). |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `InstantPageV2ListMarkerItem.checkboxPath: [Int]?`; a `pathPrefix: [Int]` threaded through `layoutBlockSequence`/`layoutBlock`/`layoutList`/`layoutDetails`/`layoutBlockQuote` stamps each `.checklist` marker with its path. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` | `InstantPageV2ListMarkerView` installs a tap gesture when `interactive`, flips its own `CheckNode` optimistically, and fires `onCheckboxTapped(path, newValue)`; `InstantPageV2View.checkboxTapped` routes it up (mirrors `detailsTapped`). |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Components/ChatControllerInteraction/Sources/ChatControllerInteraction.swift` | `canEditMessageRichText: (EngineRawMessage) -> Bool` (sync gate, mirrors `canSetupReply`) + `toggleMessageRichTextCheckbox: (EngineMessage.Id, [Int], Bool) -> Void` (the edit action). Both have no-op defaults so only the real chat wires them. |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Sources/ChatController.swift` | Implements both closures. The toggle looks up the message, re-checks `canEditMessage`, applies `togglingCheckbox`, and submits via `pendingUpdateMessageManager.add(text: "", richText:)` — the composer's rich-edit path (mirrors the native-todo `requestToggleTodoMessageItem`). |
| `submodules/TelegramUI/Components/Chat/.../ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode.swift` | `checkboxesInteractive(item:resolved:)` gate + sets `pageView.checkboxTapped` per apply. |

Non-obvious invariants:

- **Checkbox identity is a structural `[Int]` path**, not an ordinal: each element indexes the current container's children — block-array index at page/`.details`/`.blockQuote`/list-item-`.blocks` levels; item index at `.list` level. The layout stamping (`InstantPageV2Layout`) and the toggle walker (`InstantPageCheckboxToggle`) MUST keep identical semantics — they were built and reviewed as a matched pair. Decoupled from `<details>` expand/collapse state.
- **The path is absolute-from-root only because every `layoutBlockSequence` that can reach a list is entered with a correct prefix.** The two secondary `layoutBlockSequence` call sites (table cells, hard-coded `[.paragraph]`; and the details title) contain no lists, so no checkbox is produced there; a `kind != .cell` guard in `layoutList` is belt-and-suspenders against future misrouting.
- **The toggle applies to `attribute.instantPage`, so taps must only ever fire against that page.** The bubble's `checkboxesInteractive` gate enforces this: interactive only when `resolved.key` is `.original` AND `resolved.instantPage === attribute.instantPage` (class identity — excludes the show-more `fullInstantPage` rendering, which shares the `.original` key but is a different `InstantPage` object) AND `canEditMessageRichText(item.message)`. Translations (`.translated`) and in-flight pending edits (`.pendingEdit`) are inert. Non-editable messages (incoming, past the edit window) are inert — and AI-streamed rich messages are incoming, hence never tappable.
- **Optimistic flip, model supersedes.** The marker view flips its own `CheckNode` on tap; the pending/edited attribute re-render then supersedes (or, on failure, reverts, since the model was unchanged). Known minor edges of this state-free optimism: (1) an unrelated `update()` before the pending edit lands rebuilds the marker from the old `checked`, briefly reverting the visual; (2) a rapid double-tap re-reads the still-stale `checked` and re-sends the same value rather than toggling back — the pending-edit manager coalesces, so the net state is consistent, just not a double-toggle. Both are acceptable given the edit lands promptly.
- **Gating uses closures because `canEditMessage` is `internal` to the `TelegramUI` module** and the rich-data bubble lives in a separate component module that cannot call it. The two closures bridge the boundary; **their init-parameter order must match the `ChatController` call-site order** (Swift requirement) — they sit between `displayTodoToggleUnavailable` and `openStarsPurchase`.

## InstantPageBlock.blockQuote nested blocks

`InstantPageBlock.blockQuote` carries `(blocks: [InstantPageBlock], caption: RichText)` — a sequence of nested page blocks (paragraphs, headings, lists, code, even nested quotes), not the legacy text-only payload. `.pullQuote` is unchanged (still `(text: RichText, caption: RichText)`; the TL API has no `pullQuoteBlocks` constructor).

Spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-instantpage-blockquote-blocks-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-instantpage-blockquote-blocks-design.md).

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/SyncCore/SyncCore_InstantPage.swift` | Enum case shape; Postbox coding (legacy `"t"` lift → new `"b"` object array); equality (array-aware, mirrors `.collage`); FlatBuffers codec. |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/FlatSerialization/Models/InstantPageBlock.fbs` | `InstantPageBlock_BlockQuote`: `text` (now optional, legacy fallback) + `caption (required)` + new `blocks:[InstantPageBlock] (id: 2)`. **Source of truth**; Bazel regenerates the `*_generated.swift`. |
| `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/ApiUtils/InstantPage.swift` | Parse both `pageBlockBlockquote` (lift text→`[.paragraph]`) and `pageBlockBlockquoteBlocks`; encode legacy-when-possible. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `layoutBlockQuote(blocks:…)` recurses into children; legacy single-paragraph fast path delegates to `layoutQuoteText` (the renamed shared text core, also used by `.pullQuote`). |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageLayout.swift` | V1 `.blockQuote` arm recurses via `layoutInstantPageBlock(...)`; same single-paragraph fast path. |
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/BrowserMarkdown.swift` | Forward: one quote carrying all child blocks. Entity-expressibility gate (below). |
| `submodules/BrowserUI/Sources/InstantPageToMarkdown.swift` | Reverse: `markdownBlockQuoteBlocks(_:)` recurses per child and prefixes `> ` per line. |
| `submodules/TelegramStringFormatting/Sources/InstantPagePreviewText.swift` | Concatenates child `previewText()`s + caption. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Legacy shapes lift to `[.paragraph(text)]` at every decode boundary.** API `pageBlockBlockquote`, the Postbox `"t"` key (old cached pages), and the FlatBuffers `text` field (now optional) each lift into a single-paragraph blocks array. New writes emit only `blocks` (`"b"` / the FB vector). So pre-existing stored pages and older senders decode unchanged.
- **Outbound stays on the legacy wire constructor when the shape allows.** `apiInputBlock()` emits `pageBlockBlockquote` for empty or single-`.paragraph` quotes (so older recipients understand the common chat case) and `pageBlockBlockquoteBlocks` only for genuinely nested quotes.
- **Both renderers share one text core for the single-paragraph fast path.** `layoutQuoteText` (V2; the function formerly named `layoutBlockQuote`, `isPull:` distinguishes pull vs block) and the V1 fast-path branch keep the legacy italicized-body styling; nested children render with their own normal category styling.
- **Nested children use a FIXED 10pt inter-child gap, not `spacingBetweenBlocks`.** The full page-flow spacing (~27pt around quotes) is too airy when nested, and 0 is too tight. `childSpacing = 10.0` lives in both layout files; the first child hugs the container's `verticalInset` (no leading gap). Combined with a nested quote's own 4pt top inset this gives ~14pt effective separation.
- **Entity-expressibility:** a quote is entity-expressible (→ regular message path) only if its caption is empty AND every child is an entity-expressible `.paragraph`. A nested-structure or multi-paragraph quote is not, so it sends via the rich path. **Behavior change:** markdown `> p1\n>\n> p2` is now ONE quote with two paragraphs (rich) rather than two consecutive entity quotes — correct semantics.
- **The enum-arity change is compile-enforced** across all modules; the full Bazel build is the completeness gate (no per-module build). `CachedFaqInstantPage.swift` matches `case .blockQuote:` payload-less and needs no edit. `BrowserReadability.swift` constructs `.blockQuote(blocks: [.paragraph(.italic(...))], …)` and is easy to miss in the spec's file list — grep `\.blockQuote(` repo-wide when touching the case again.

## InstantPage thinking blocks (InstantPageBlock.thinking)

`InstantPageBlock.thinking(RichText)` renders server-sent reasoning as dimmed, continuously-shimmering text inside rich-data bubbles. V2 renderer only; V1 ignores the block (returns `[]`). The shimmer and fade-in mechanics are deliberately separate from the char-reveal cursor so thinking blocks do not affect the reveal pacing of the answer content that follows them.

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2Layout.swift` | `InstantPageV2ThinkingItem` layout item + `layoutThinking(...)` (paragraph color × 0.55 alpha for the dimmed style) + `layoutBlock` `.thinking` arm. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` | `InstantPageV2ThinkingView` — a `ShimmeringMaskView` wrapping a private inner `InstantPageV2TextView`; `InstantPageV2StableItemId.thinking(Int)` stable-id namespace; `makeItemView`/`reuse`/`stableId` arms for the `.thinking` item kind; the two-counter (content + thinking) stable-id loop in `InstantPageV2View.update`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageV2RevealCost.swift` | `.thinking(start:)` cost entry: contributes **zero** cursor cost; triggers whole-block alpha fade-in when `revealedCount >= start`. |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageLayout.swift` | V1 has no explicit `.thinking` case — it falls through `layoutInstantPageBlock`'s `default:` to an empty layout (no-op). |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Zero reveal cost is the linchpin.** Thinking blocks do not advance the width-based cursor, so the answer's reveal position is identical whether or not thinking blocks are present — and is unaffected as they appear and disappear across streaming chunks. The answer text always reveals at the same rate regardless of how much thinking precedes it.
- **Whole-block fade, not char reveal.** The inner text is drawn fully under the shimmer mask at all times; the reveal mechanism is a simple alpha visibility keyed to the block's `start` index. A top-of-page thinking block (`start == 0`) is visible from the very first frame.
- **Shimmer runs continuously while the view is displayed** via `ShimmeringMaskView`'s `HierarchyTrackingLayer` self-animation. It does not stop when streaming ends.
- **Top-level only; separate stable-id namespace.** Thinking blocks appear only at the top level of the page. They use the `InstantPageV2StableItemId.thinking(Int)` namespace, numbered by a counter independent of content blocks. This means adding or removing a thinking block never renumbers the stable ids of content blocks — which, combined with pageView reuse, ensures content views and reveal state persist as thinking blocks come and go across chunks.
- **V1 is a no-op.** `InstantPageLayout.swift` has no `.thinking` case; the block falls through `layoutInstantPageBlock`'s `default:` to an empty layout, so V1 rendering silently skips it.

## Anchor navigation in rich bubbles (intra-message `#anchor` links)

Tapping a fragment-only link (`[Jump](#section)`) inside a rich-data bubble scrolls the chat so the matching in-message anchor lands ~8pt below the content-area top, expanding any enclosing collapsed `<details>` first. Anchors come from **server/AI-sent** InstantPages only — block-level `InstantPageBlock.anchor(name)` or inline `RichText.anchor` over a heading/paragraph; the markdown **compose** path deliberately skips generating heading-slug anchors for chat (`markdownBlocksWithGeneratedAnchors` runs only for documents), so user-typed messages have no anchors. The whole downstream scroll chain (`ChatControllerInteraction.scrollToMessageIdWithAnchor` → `ChatMessageBubbleItemNode.getAnchorRect` → `historyNode.scrollToMessage(.bottom(anchorY))`) pre-existed; this feature fills the two bubble-side seams that were stubbed.

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageRenderer.swift` | `InstantPageV2View.anchorFrame(name:)` (live-layout frame walk, mirrors `findTextItem`; handles `.text`/`.codeBlock`/`.thinking`/`.details`/`.table`) + `firstCollapsedDetails(forOrdinalPath:)` (maps an ordinal path to the first not-yet-expanded `<details>`'s live index). |
| `submodules/InstantPageUI/Sources/InstantPageAnchorPath.swift` | **NEW.** Pure `instantPageAnchorPath(in:name:)` model walk → the `<details>`-sibling-ordinal path to an anchor (`nil` = absent, `[]` = outside any details, `[2,0]` = inside the 3rd top-level details then its 1st nested details) + `richTextContainsAnchor`. |
| `…/Chat/ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode/…` | `getAnchorRect` (delegates to `anchorFrame`, +8pt top margin); the `tapActionAtPoint` fragment route + streaming gate; the `scrollToAnchor` resolve→expand→scroll state machine (`pendingScrollAnchor` + progress guard); the post-relayout hook. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **The ordinal path is mapped to live indices, never reproduced.** The layout's `detailsIndexCounter` (`InstantPageV2Layout.swift`) is **expansion-dependent** — a `<details>` nested inside a *collapsed* parent has no index until the parent expands and re-lays-out (a collapsed details has `innerLayout == nil`; its children aren't laid out). So `instantPageAnchorPath` returns ordinals, and `firstCollapsedDetails` reads the real index from the live laid-out `.details` item. Expansion is iterative: expand one collapsed level → `requestMessageUpdate` → the post-relayout hook re-runs `scrollToAnchor` → repeat until the anchor resolves via `anchorFrame`.
- **The model walk's recursion set MUST equal the containers the V2 layout recurses through `layoutBlock`** (and thus counts `<details>` in via `detailsIndexCounter`): exactly `.blockQuote`, `.cover`, and `.list`'s `.blocks` items — all of which the layout **flattens** into the parent `items` array (only `layoutDetails` nests a separate `innerLayout`, which is the level boundary). `instantPageAnchorPath` recurses those three sharing the `inout detailsOrdinal`, and treats `.details` as a new level. It deliberately does **NOT** recurse `.postEmbed`/`.collage`/`.slideshow` — the V2 layout lays out only their media/caption (never their child blocks), so it never counts a `<details>` inside them; recursing them would desync the model walk's ordinals from the layout. An anchor inside such a non-laid-out child is unresolvable by `anchorFrame` anyway, so skipping it is a no-op either way.
- **`anchorFrame` and the model walk are only ever both consulted when `anchorFrame` fails.** `scrollToAnchor` first tries `anchorFrame` (covers everything currently laid out — top level, expanded details, tables, thinking blocks); only on a miss does it consult `instantPageAnchorPath`. So the only consequential model-walk output is a **non-empty** path (anchor buried in a collapsed details); `nil`/`[]` both no-op.
- **`getAnchorRect` stays a pure synchronous query.** ChatController calls it inside `forEachVisibleItemNode`; all expansion is orchestrated by `scrollToAnchor`/`pendingScrollAnchor` **before** the scroll fires. The chat scroll consumes only the returned rect's `minY`.
- **Anchor taps are rejected while the message streams** (`TypingDraftMessageAttribute`) → `.none`. So `pendingScrollAnchor` is only ever set post-stream, and the reveal cursor never interacts with anchor scrolling.
- **A fragment-only URL (`#…`, empty base) is always intercepted** — never opened as an external URL. If it resolves → scroll; if not (missing or empty anchor) → no-op (press-highlight only). A real URL carrying a fragment (`https://x.com/p#s`, non-empty base) keeps the unchanged external-URL handling.
- **The expansion loop terminates** via a progress guard (`lastExpandedPendingDetailsIndex == collapsedIndex` → give up): each relayout pass either resolves+scrolls (clearing pending) or advances to a strictly deeper collapsed `<details>`.
- **No `activate:` on the anchor tap action** (unlike external-URL taps): anchor scrolling is local and instant, so the link-loading shimmer (`makeActivate`) would falsely imply network activity. The press-highlight `rects` are still passed.

## "Show more" for partial rich messages (on-demand full page)

A server-sent rich message can arrive **partial** when the content is long: the `RichMessage` `isPartial` flag maps to `instantPage.isComplete == false`. The bubble then renders the partial page plus an inline **"Show more"** link; tapping it fetches the full page (once) and expands the bubble in place.

### Data model

- `RichTextMessageAttribute` (`SyncCore_RichTextMessageAttribute.swift`) carries the partial `instantPage` **and** an optional `fullInstantPage: InstantPage?` (nil until fetched). The partial page is **never replaced** — the full page is stored alongside it (encoded/decoded; both in `==`).
- `engine.messages.requestFullRichText(id:)` (`TelegramEngineMessages.swift`) requests `messages.getRichMessage`, then `transaction.updateMessage(id,…)` sets the existing attribute's `fullInstantPage` to the fetched complete page (keeping `instantPage`), and returns the updated attribute. It yields `.single(nil)` for non-Cloud ids and on network failure (no postbox change).
- The seed-config merge (`SyncCore_StandaloneAccountTransaction.swift`) preserves a previously-fetched `fullInstantPage` if a later server update for the same message arrives without one (same partial `instantPage`).

### Where things live

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `…/TelegramCore/Sources/SyncCore/SyncCore_RichTextMessageAttribute.swift` | The `fullInstantPage` field (init / encode / decode / `==`). |
| `…/TelegramCore/Sources/TelegramEngine/Messages/TelegramEngineMessages.swift` | `requestFullRichText(id:)` — fetch + `updateMessage` to fill `fullInstantPage`. |
| `…/TelegramCore/Sources/SyncCore/SyncCore_StandaloneAccountTransaction.swift` | Seed-config merge preserving a fetched `fullInstantPage` across later updates. |
| `…/Chat/ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode/…` | The "Show more" link (layout, tap via `tapActionAtPoint` `.custom` + `updateTouchesAtPoint` highlight, `TextLoadingEffectView` shimmer), the node-local expand state, the effective-page selection, and the downward-expand. |
| `Telegram/Telegram-iOS/en.lproj/Localizable.strings` | `Chat.RichText.ShowMore` = "Show more" (→ `strings.Chat_RichText_ShowMore`). |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **Expand state is node-local and per-message, NOT derived from the attribute.** `showMoreExpanded: (messageId, value)?` is snapshotted at layout time and resolved against the current `item.message.id`, so **every fresh display of a message starts collapsed (partial)** even when its attribute already carries a cached `fullInstantPage`; only an in-place tap expands, and that expansion survives same-message relayouts. Resolving against the message id makes any *other* message collapse automatically (no stale-snapshot bug, no manual reset).
- **The bubble renders `(showMoreExpanded ? attribute.fullInstantPage : nil) ?? attribute.instantPage`** — the full page only while expanded — in both the webpage build and `layoutInstantPageV2`. `scrollToAnchor` resolves anchors against the same effective page.
- **The link shows only when `!showMoreExpanded` AND `!attribute.instantPage.isComplete`** (plus the original gates: not streaming via `TypingDraftMessageAttribute`, `id.namespace == .Cloud` since `requestFullRichText` is a no-op otherwise, and not a preview / `.messageOptions` context). The date/status trails the link's line by substituting the link frame for the last-text-line frame (see the status-node section).
- **`showMoreExpanded` is part of BOTH layout caches.** It is in the `currentPageLayout` cache key **and** the `pageView` content key (`pageViewMessageKey`). This is required because the cached-expand path (full page already on the attribute) performs **no postbox write**, so `stableVersion` does not bump — without the key, the cached partial layout/content would shadow the expand.
- **Tap (`activateShowMore`):** if `fullInstantPage` is already cached → set expanded + `requestMessageUpdate` immediately (no network, no shimmer); otherwise shimmer the link and fetch, expanding only once the full page lands. Guards against a second in-flight request and against re-expanding.
- **Expand grows the bubble downward in screen space** (top fixed) via `info?.setInvertOffsetDirection()` on the `ListViewItemApply` in the apply closure, fired only on the `appliedShowMoreExpanded → showMoreExpanded` transition (never on first apply). Same mechanism as `ChatMessageInteractiveFileNode`'s audio-transcription expand and the text/fact-check bubbles; the ListView clamps it to what fits.

## Rich-message media in the gallery / shared-media / preview pipelines (`Message.effectiveMedia`)

A rich message's media (images / videos / audio / documents) lives in `attribute.instantPage.media`, **not** in `message.media` (which is empty — rich messages are sent with `text: ""` and no media reference). To make that media participate in the *same* shared-media-index, gallery, file-list, playback, download, and save/copy pipelines that normal `message.media` flows through, there is one shared accessor and a set of opt-in call-site swaps.

### The accessor

`Message.effectiveMedia: [Media]` (+ a delegating `EngineMessage.effectiveMedia`) in `submodules/TelegramCore/Sources/Utils/MessageUtils.swift`:

```swift
var effectiveMedia: [Media] {
    if !self.media.isEmpty { return self.media }     // normal message: identical to message.media
    if let richText = self.richText { return richText.instantPage.allMedia() }  // rich: the instant-page media
    return self.media
}
```

`Message.richText` (same file) is already a typed `RichTextMessageAttribute?`; `InstantPage.allMedia()` (`SyncCore_InstantPage.swift`) recursively gathers media from the page's blocks (audio/collage/cover/details/image/list/slideshow/video) via its `[MediaId: Media]` dict. **For a normal message `effectiveMedia == message.media`**, so swapping a `message.media` read for `message.effectiveMedia` is behavior-preserving for non-rich content and only adds the rich media where the site should consider it. **Scope is first-media** for now (call sites keep their `.first` / iterate-and-break logic; the helper returns all media but callers stop at the first match — the `//TODO:rewrite to take all media` markers remain).

### Where things live

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| **Discovery / index** | `tagsForStoreMessage` (`StoreMessage_Telegram.swift`) indexes rich media into `MessageTags` (photo/video/gif/voice/file). **This is the linchpin**: it makes rich messages *appear* in every tag-queried surface (shared-media tabs, search, downloads) — which is exactly why each rendering-side site below then needs `effectiveMedia`, or it renders the surfaced message blank. |
| **Extraction helper** | `Message.effectiveMedia` (above). |
| **Shared-media grids / rows** | `PeerInfoVisualMediaPaneNode`, `PeerInfoGifPaneNode`, `ListMessageItem` (row-type selection) + `ListMessageFileItemNode` (file/music/voice row), `ChatListSearchMediaNode` (search media grid). |
| **Gallery open + items** | `GalleryController` (`tagsForMessage` + `mediaForMessage` — the duplicated `message.media`/`message.richText` blocks were collapsed into one `effectiveMedia` loop), `GalleryData.chatMessageGalleryControllerData`, `SecretMediaPreviewController` (its own local `mediaForMessage`), and the gallery item nodes `ChatDocumentGalleryItem` / `ChatExternalFileGalleryItem` / `ChatAnimationGalleryItem` (these re-derive from `message.media` in `node()`, so a rich doc/animation rendered **blank** without the swap) + `UniversalVideoGalleryItem` secondary affordances + `ChatItemGalleryFooterContentNode`. |
| **Playback** | `PeerMessagesMediaPlaylist.extractFileMedia` (the peer music/voice playlist), `OverlayAudioPlayerControllerNode` (audio context menu). |
| **Resolution / downloads / cleanup** | `FetchedMediaResource.findMediaResourceById(message:)`, `SyncCore_RecentDownloadItem`, `StoreDownloadedMedia`, `DeleteMessages.addMessageMediaResourceIdsToRemove(message:)` (rich media was **leaking on delete**), `CollectCacheUsageStats`, `ChatHistoryListNode` (download manager), `ChatListSearch{ListPaneNode,ContainerNode}`. |
| **Actions** | `ChatInterfaceStateContextMenus` (Save-to-Camera-Roll, copy-image, save-audio/music-to-files, debug/premium), `ChatControllerNode` (post-suggestion media ref), `ChatControllerLoadDisplayNode` (edit send-validation), `ShareController.saveToCameraRoll`. |

### Non-obvious invariants

- **The tag-index change is what creates the work.** `tagsForStoreMessage` surfacing rich messages into tag-queried lists, *without* the rendering-side `effectiveMedia` swaps, produces visible **blank cells / blank rows / wrong row types**. Index and render must move together.
- **The rich message's own in-chat bubble + in-bubble gallery do NOT read `message.media`** — a rich message renders via `ChatMessageRichDataBubbleContentNode` (InstantPage V2), in-bubble image/video tap opens `InstantPageGalleryController` (reads the instant page directly), and in-bubble audio uses `InstantPageV2AudioContentNode`. So the text-bubble / interactive-file / interactive-media nodes' `message.media` reads are **never reached by a rich message** and are deliberately left alone.
- **Do NOT route the FORWARD path through `effectiveMedia`** (`ChatControllerNode` `forwardedMessages` ~556/560/568). The `RichTextMessageAttribute` already travels with a forward, so the forwarded copy reconstructs from the attribute; injecting the instant-page media as top-level `message.media` there would **double-render** (rich bubble + a separate media attachment). That `message.media` processing is caption-hiding / poll-stripping only, both irrelevant to rich — left as `message.media`.
- **Rich messages are edited as reconstructed MARKDOWN, not via the media-caption edit path.** So `ChatControllerLoadDisplayNode`'s edit caption-max-length / original-media-reference reads (~1241/1775/4463) stay on `message.media` — they belong to the `.media` edit state a rich message never enters. (The send-*validation* `.contains` at ~2273 IS swapped, so an edit that leaves only media isn't wrongly rejected.)
- **`RichTextMessageAttribute.associatedMediaIds` stays `[]` — intentionally.** `MessageHistoryTable` resolves `associatedMediaIds` via `getMedia(id)` in the postbox **media table**, but rich-message media is embedded inside the attribute blob, not the table — so returning the keys would be a no-op without also inserting the media into the table. The embedded-blob approach is self-contained.
- **`fullInstantPage` is not indexed** (the server doesn't index it either, and it's fetched on demand after store-time). The first media lives in the partial `instantPage` anyway.
- **Only switch the loop SOURCE, never the per-type branches.** Many swapped loops still contain `TelegramMediaPoll`/`TelegramMediaPaidContent`/`TelegramMediaWebpage` branches that rich messages never match — that's fine and intentional; only the `for … in <msg>.media` source changes.
- **Build-only completeness gate.** Every swap is type-identical (`[Media]` → `[Media]`), so the only compile risk is a receiver that is neither `Message` nor `EngineMessage`; the full Bazel build is the gate (no per-module build / unit tests). Deferred, NOT done: chat-list/reply/pinned/notification/forward thumbnail **previews** and the "Photo"/"Video" media-kind **labels** (`messageContentKind`/`ChatListItemStrings`) — those are preview surfaces, not blank-cell breakage — and **multi-media** (first-media-only is the current scope).
